@10000 = ~Angelfist +5~
@10001 = ~Created in the celestial forges of Elysium, Angelfist is a warhammer imbued with divine purpose. Its head is radiant silver, glowing with a soft, ethereal light that illuminates the darkest corners of the material plane. Angelic decorations and symbols adorn it, blessed by the heavens themselves. It feels warm and comforting to the touch.

When wielded, Angelfist feels alive, throbbing with the fire of righteousness and justice. Each swing resonates with a heavenly chorus that intensifies when using its Heavenly Hammer ability. Upon striking a foe, it delivers not only physical might but also a searing burst of radiant energy. Enemies struck by Angelfist find themselves momentarily blinded, as if caught in the gaze of the divine.

How this weapon fell into the hands of the Winged, none know or have the courage to ask, as even gazing upon it may draw her ire. However, it is rumored to be her only comfort, the reason she can endure the presence of mortals.

@10060 = ~Astral Crowssbow of Speed +4~
@10061 = ~This crossbow is a sleek, silvered weapon adorned with faintly glowing etchings of celestial constellations. When bolts are loaded into it, they seem to shimmer and vanish, only to reappear in the bowstring, ready to be fired. The weapon is light and easy to handle, and the wielder feels a sense of calm and focus when using it.

Even without bolts, the crossbow can fire ethereal bolts of pure magical energy, dealing damage to the target as if they were physical. Either way, the bolts fired are infused with the power of the Astral Plane, and can cause massive damage to outsiders and the undead.

@10080 = ~Staff of Disruption +1~
@10081 = ~A cousin of the more well-known mace of disruption, this ornate staff is the invention of Thulsmine Achenfell, an aspirant necromancer from the Great Dale that sought to raise an undead army from within the Rawlinswood. His ambition proved his folly, however, as his would-be servants proved too unwieldy for him to control. The hoard turned against its master, spreading through the forest and forcing Thulsmine into a shameful retreat.

Embittered by the experience, Thulsmine found his true calling when he began crafting a weapon that could fix his mistake—not out of a desire to right any wrongs, but to simply remove any evidence of his incompetence. With this, the first staff of disruption was born. So effective it was at the eradication of his undead creations that Thulsmine lost himself in the experience—quite literally. His spellbook in tatters and his undead army naught but dust, the wizard wandered the Rawlinswood until his untimely demise, perishing alone in the very woods he had once sought to conquer.

It is unlikely that this staff is the same one that Thulsmine wielded, but it carries his legacy nonetheless. Infused with the same disruptive power, it still hums with the magic he used to undo his creations.

These gloves fit snugly around her hands, and are made of a soft, supple leather that is surprisingly durable. They are unadorned, save for a small, stylized 'N' on the back of each hand.

@10112 = ~Vyatri's Note~ //quest
@10113 = ~The Pits of Despair: Desperate and True by Baeloth Barrityl Dictated but not read~
@10114 = ~Reviewed by Altharion Veldrith, Scholar of the Arcane and Occasional Tavern Critic

Baeloth Barrityl, the notorious drow socerer and self-proclaimed "Entertainer" has once again unleashed his literary prowess upon the unsuspecting masses. His latest work, The Pits of Despair: Desperate and True, is a rousing mix of drama, despair, and – as one might expect – a rather excessive amount of self-aggrandizement.

However, there are moments in which Barrityl's over-the-top style gets the best of him. The prose often veers into the theatrical—though, given that this is a work by a drow socerer, this is perhaps to be expected. The narrative is occasionally interrupted by lengthy monologues that read as though they were lifted directly from one of Barrityl's own performances, making it unclear whether the book is a story or simply a vehicle for Barrityl's self-promotion. One could imagine him standing on a stage, flourishing dramatically as he dictates each word with an exaggerated flourish. If you enjoy the sound of your own voice (or, in this case, the written word) more than the development of characters and plot, this might suit your taste.

In conclusion, The Pits of Despair: Desperate and True is a book that will divide its audience. Some will find it a masterpiece of bleak, brooding storytelling—an ode to the complexities of the soul and the burdens of heroism. Others will be turned off by its heavy-handed melodrama and self-indulgent prose. Still, as a work dictated by Baeloth Barrityl himself, it is undeniably fascinating and worthy of attention, if only for its sheer audacity and bravado. Whether or not you emerge from the pits of despair with any sense of hope is a matter for each reader to decide.

Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5 stars)

@10150 = ~Gruumsh's Totem~
@10151 = ~Among the Ashmaw clan—a powerful but relatively secretive clan of orcs that once lived amongst the Sunset Mountains—the most devout servants of Gruumsh were not allowed to fall into obscurity. Death was seen as merely a threshold, and the greatest of their warriors, shamans, and chieftains were not left to decay in the frozen reaches of their homeland. Instead, their heads were severed in grizzly rituals, dried in the smoke of pinewood fires, and then serenaded in the name of Grummsh.

Fashioned into easily carryable totems by shamanic magic, they were oft brought into battle by the fiercest of the Ashmaw, who sought both the wisdom and fury of their ancestors. Clutching the totem was said to awaken the rage of the dead, flooding the wielder with visions of fury and bloodshed, goading them into a battle frenzy.

The shrunken head that dangles from this beaded leather cord bears the markings of a battle-scarred warrior, a singular preserved eye appearing to watch those that hold it, and his mouth caught in a voracious battle-cry.

Dapper Jack went through life learning the finesse of a thief, the style of a fighter, the devotion of a cleric, and the determination of a mage before eventually creating this item at the end years of his own long life.

Lady Katarina: I salute your taste,  my Lord Dominic,  exactly the delightful earthy tones you described- my, is that the bottle gone? One might suspect a less honorable and handsome man of plying me with drink... oh, but wait, we still need another bottle! I meant to toast the Hero of Baldur's Gate, and hear the story of how you knew them!
Dominick: I… I apoloshize, my lady, when I said I knew the Hero, I meant more from... um, afar. I was there, though, Baldur's Gate, when they saved the city! Me and my father, we were vishiting... right, right in the thick of it on a visit, heard of the near war, everything!
Lady Katarina: Oh. What a sly rascal, to have deceived so... You wouldn't lie to me now that we are such good friends, would you, my dear?
Dominick: Never, Mish Katarina. You can trust me. They were so brave and incredible. The evil war… warrior Sarevok was killing everyone and it was he who nearly started the war! The hero came from Candlekeep and they were related! Related, I say!
Lady Katarina: Do continue! I cannot deny an appetite for such gossip... have you heard anything of the Hero being here Amn? Have you any notion of why they might be?
Dominick: OH, yesh! First there wasesh this mad mage Irenikish and he caught the hero becaush he was a CH… ILD OF BHAAAL and...
