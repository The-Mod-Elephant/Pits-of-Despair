@0    = ~I tire of this prattle. Take them!~ [OH90460]
@1    = ~Such a creature is beyond even our power. Send us on a suicide mission like that again and our relationship—to say nothing of your life—will be at an end.~ [OH100573]
@2    = ~You fought a tarrasque and lived? Impressive!~
@3    = ~If you agreed to hunt a tarrasque, you got what you deserved.~
@4    = ~I'll end your relationship with him right now.~
@5    = ~I'm glad you made it. All scores will be settled this <DAYNIGHTALL>!~
@6    = ~It will be done.~ [OH100575]
@7    = ~Hold, Dennaton. These drow have not yet been paid for.~ [OH94236]
@8    = ~Yes. I will get my money now.~ [OH94238]
@9    = ~See that I receive every last copper coming to me. Or we will see how well YOU fare in these pits of yours.~ [OH94240]
@10   = ~Sorry, I don't think so.~
@11   = ~That IS inappropriate!~
@12   = ~So shut your face. Dennaton hasn't prohibited roughing you up.~
@13   = ~I've nothing to say to you, performer.~
@14   = ~Rude!~
@15   = ~Oh, I doubt that's true. I bet you've seen all sorts of things around here.~
@16   = ~Then I'll leave you alone.~
@17   = ~Quit bothering me!~
@18   = ~Come on, I'm bored. I bet you've seen all sorts of interesting things 'round here. Tell me some of them, please.~
@19   = ~As you wish.~
@20   = ~Not nearly as rude as a sword in the face, which is what you'll get if you don't leave me alone!~
@21   = ~What part of "I've nothing to say to you," don't you understand? Begone!~
@22   = ~Back off! The first autograph is MINE!~
@23   = ~Relax, everyone. No need to get pushy!~
@24   = ~Great, everyone here knows me now. Another tavern ruined...~
@25   = ~Right then. everyone line up. 10 gold per autograph!~
@26   = ~What? After so long, I am flesh once again? Hah! The arcane power flows through me once more. Bannor is returned!~
@27   = ~I am at peace with that. We came here for <CHARNAME>. You are expendable.~
@28   = ~Greetin's. *Achoo!* *sniff* How may I... W-wait a second. Do I know you?~ [OH90864]
@29   = ~Bellowgulp! It's me, <CHARNAME>! What are you doing here?~
@30   = ~I'm not really sure. Who are you?~
@31   = ~Great. The deranged gnome and his pet mushroom. What's your name again? Buttgoop?~

@32   = ~*Achoo!* Bellowgulp Bluefingers is my name, and this here is the Concocter. We were imprisoned with you in Baeloth's Pits.~ [OH90868]
@33   = ~We set up shop brewin' potions, just like always. *Achoo!* Potions to make ya stronger, quicker, and smarter. We even have potions to catch the eye of the ladies or the gentlemen!~ [OH90869]
@34   = ~Quite a sales pitch. I'll have a look.~
@35   = ~Maybe later, Bellowgulp. I need to be off.~
@36   = ~I need something to stabilize Dulf Ebonbeard's mind.~
@37   = ~May I ask you a few questions?~
@38   = ~I'll not buy potions made by an oversized toadstool.~
@39   = ~Hah! Couldn't have said it better myself, Concocter, though I doubt even a troll would birth somethin' as rude as THIS performer. Now listen, you. You'd best be polite to us merchants or you'll never get the gear you'll need to survive. *Achoo!*~ [OH90876]
@40   = ~Sorry, Bellowgulp. I was trying to make a joke, but... Well, let's change the subject.~
@41   = ~I'm sorry. I'll leave you be.~
@42   = ~As if I'd need your impotent brews.~
@43   = ~Come back if you need potions of any sort. *Achoo!*~ [OH90883]
@44   = ~I'm always happy to reminisce with an old friend such as yerself. *Achoo!*~ [OH90884]
@45   = ~What's with the sneezing?~
@46   = ~How'd you end up here?~
@47   = ~Why does the cook keep looking at the Concocter that way?~
@48   = ~May I see your wares?~
@49   = ~Never mind. I must be leaving.~
/* Below line removes reference to Baeloth's Pit - voice line gets removed */
@50   = ~Oh, that. The Concocter communicates by releasin' spores. It seems I've developed an allergy to *achoo!* them. *Achoo!*~ [ZBLANK]
@51   = ~That's... awkward. Let's speak of something else.~
@52   = ~Yeah, I'll just be going now.~
@53   = ~That's hilarious! You deserve it for having such a creepy friend.~
@54   = ~When the spores reached my nose, I started sneezin' uncontrollably. I sneezed so hard I did a full backflip and landed face down on top of the Concocter. The hunters thought it was so funny they decided to keep us alive and bring us here. *Achoo!*~ [OH90898]
@55   = ~At least they let you live. I'd like to see your wares now, if I may.~
@56   = ~Better alive than dead, I suppose. I'll be going now.~
@57   = ~Let's discuss something else.~
@58   = ~A cowardly myconid and an acrobatic svirfneblin? You two should be in a circus.~
@59   = ~Anyway, the cook liked the stew so much he's been tryin' to convince Dennaton to let him cook the rest of the Concocter ever since. Wretched dwarf! *Achoo!*~ [OH90905]
@60   = ~Disgusting... Ah, well. Let's see your wares.~
@61   = ~At least he hasn't succeeded yet. I must be going now.~
@62   = ~Perhaps we could discuss something else. ANYthing else.~
@63   = ~Myconid stew. Sounds like a treat.~
@64   = ~How may I help ya? *Achoo!*~ [OH92084]
@65   = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@66   = ~I was wondering if I could have a piece of the Concocter for the cook's stew.~
@67   = ~Do you think the Concocter could make something... special for me?~
@68   = ~I have a potion of barkskin. Could you make it into powdered funguswood?~
@69   = ~O' course! Ask away!~ [OH90914]
@70   = ~Don't you think Dennaton should be compensating you for your services?~
@71   = ~Perhaps. What would be the purpose of this "somethin' special"?~ [OH90917]
@72   = ~I need some powdered funguswood.~
@73   = ~I'm trying to poison Joker.~
@74   = ~On second thought, I changed my mind. I must be going.~
@75   = ~Pretty nosy for a gnome. Forget it. You Underdark types make me nervous.~
@76   = ~The Concocter says it'll be hard to get. It won't come cheap. It'll cost 750 gold pieces and require a potion of barkskin. *Achoo!*~ [OH90923]
@77   = ~I'll return when I have the potion and the gold.~
@78   = ~Potion of barkskin? Where can I find that?~
@79   = ~I have a potion of barkskin right here.~
@80   = ~The potion-maker needs a potion? That doesn't speak highly of your skills, does it?~
@81   = ~I've seen some around. One of the other merchants, or maybe the priests, might have a bottle or two.~ [OH90928]
@82   = ~What you need is the salve of senile serenity. The Concocter can brew one for only 100 gold pieces.~ [OH90929]
@83   = ~Very well, here you go.~
@84   = ~I don't have that much gold at the moment. I'll have to return later.~
@85   = ~100 gold pieces? YOU're senile if you think I'm spending that much on your stupid salve!~
@86   = ~Maybe you're right. *Achoo!* We do provide the finest potions in all Faerûn. I'll take the matter up with him.~ [OH90934]
@87   = ~Oh, I don't know. We're captives here, after all. I don't want to anger Dennaton.~ [OH90935]
@88   = ~750 gold pieces, please.~ [OH90936]
@89   = ~Here you go.~
@90   = ~If I told you it was to poison the cook, would you do it for free?~
@91   = ~You've been drinking too many of your own potions if you think I'm paying that much.~
@92   = ~*Achoo!* The Concocter says it would be a pleasure. Keep your gold and get that crazy dwarf. Here you go.~ [OH90940]
@93   = ~WHAT? The Concocter is not just a walkin' ingredient for the cook's stewpot! He's a close personal friend an' a master of potion-makin'! *Achoo!*~ [OH90941]
@94   = ~Maybe if the cook had a little more, he'd stop trying to get ALL the Concocter.~
@95   = ~I'll give you 1,000 gold pieces...~
@96   = ~My apologies, Bellowgulp. Just a little joke. I'll be going now.~
@97   = ~C'mon, Bellowgulp, you can't tell me you've never wanted just a nibble.~
@98   = ~Absolutely not. That dwarf is mad, and he's not getting even a piece of my good friend! *Achoo!*~ [OH90946]
@99   = ~Bellowgulp Bluefingers. There's no call to be rude.~ [OH90874]
@100  = ~Fine! Insult us! You'll come back, and when ya do, don't be surprised when the Concocter spits in your potions!~ [OH90880]
@101  = ~What do you mean, "myconids can't spit"? Fine. I'll spit in the potions myself, then. Now goodbye! *Achoo!*~ [OH91958]
@102  = ~That's quite a tale! The Concocter and I were searchin' for gems and potion ingredients near the Underdark city of Blingdenstone. Suddenly, that winged thing's hunters surrounded us. Still makes me shudder. *Achoo!*~ [OH90894]
@103  = ~One of 'em, a wretched half-elf known as Joker, struck the Concocter on the back o' the stem and injured 'im. *Achoo!* I leapt to my friend's defense. My svirfneblin rage forced the hunters to take us alive. *Achoo!*~ [OH90895]
@104  = ~What do ya mean, "Tell them the real story?" That WAS the real story! *Achoo!*~ [OH90896]
@105  = ~Fine, maybe I embellished a little. You can hardly blame me. Our capture was far from dignified. When Joker injured the Concocter, he emitted a piteous spore-scream.~ [OH90897]
@106  = ~That wretched dwarf! When Joker injured the Concocter, she kept the piece o' stem she cut off and gave it to the cook! *Achoo!* That lunatic made stew out of it and thought it tasted fantastic.~ [OH90903]
@107  = ~Yes, yes. I know you're very proud of how good you taste. Stop *Achoo!* interruptin'!~ [OH90904]
@108  = ~Hmm... You make a good point. Perhaps it would keep that crazy dwarf away from my friend here. What do you think, Concocter? It will grow back in a few days anyway, will it not?~ [OH90947]
@109  = ~Very well. It is agreed. Now bend over, Concocter. This won't hurt a bit. Just a quick cut and THERE! Got it. Here you go. And tell that lunatic dwarf to stay away from the Concocter from now on. *Achoo!*~ [OH90948]
@110  = ~Gems and jewels! I mean, that is a generous offer. What do you think, Concocter? We could buy a significant number of reagents with that. And you'd regenerate in a few days anyway, wouldn't you?~ [OH90949]
@111  = ~Very well. It is agreed. Bend over, Concocter—this won't hurt a bit. Just a quick cut and THERE! Got it. Here you go. Now tell that lunatic dwarf to keep away from us from now on. *Achoo!*~ [OH90950]
@112  = ~*Achoo!* The Concocter is happy to help. We've been working on a special poison for just such a purpose ever since that nasty half-elf attacked us. Very potent. I think it's around here somewhere... Here it is.~ [OH90951]
@113  = ~We heard you. The answer's no. Dennaton doesn't want his performers injured outside the arena. You don't like it, take it up with him.~
@114  = ~Yes. It does a disservice to knuckle-dragging apes everywhere.~
@115  = ~Yes. Yes, we are.~
@116  = ~I'm not paid enough to associate with scum. Talk to Tartle.~
@117  = ~Hey, I'm not scum!~
@118  = ~What if I need to talk to you?~
@119  = ~But you're so much more pleasant than him! But I'll go if that's what you want.~
@120  = ~If you need something, talk to Tartle.~
@121  = ~Very well.~
@122  = ~Wow. I hurt a slave's feelings. That rips me up inside. Now bugger off!~
@123  = ~Then you'll STILL need to talk to Tartle, because I'll not speak with you.~
@124  = ~Well, if you're not staying, neither are we. We're not paid enough to deal with the likes of <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@125  = ~What do you want, slave?~
@126  = ~Are you Branson?~
@127  = ~Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.~
@128  = ~So what if I am?~
@129  = ~Your captain asked me to kill you.~
@130  = ~Your captain thinks you talk too much.~
@131  = ~Yeah. Sure he did.~
@132  = ~He told me Dennaton's your uncle.~
@133  = ~No, honestly. He sent me to kill you.~
@134  = ~You're just too cocky for your own good. I think I'll do it after all.~
@135  = ~What? Nobody knows that... except the captain. I see.~
@136  = ~Well, I suppose I could kill you first, but that's a temporary solution. The captain isn't the sort to give up. And I can't go to my uncle; he made it clear he wouldn't look after me down here. Crap. What should I do?~
@137  = ~Run. I'll tell him you're dead and that I took care of the body.~
@138  = ~Give me 2,000 gold pieces. I'll let you go and convince the captain you're dead.~
@139  = ~I'll make this as quick as possible.~
@140  = ~You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Here, take this. It's our family ring. My uncle has one just like it. Tell the captain you got it off my body. He'll believe it.~
@141  = ~I don't keep that sort of gold on me, but here's the key to my footlocker. You'll find enough gold in there and maybe a bit more. Take it all. I'm getting out of here. Oh, take this too. It's our family ring. Dennaton has one just like it. Tell the captain you got it off my body. He'll believe it.~
@142  = ~It's a fight you want, eh? Let's go, then. You'll find I give as good as I get!~
@143  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, how fortuitous! The time to put our plan into action has arrived! Quickly, gather everyone in the performers' quarters. I'll meet you there.~ [OH92869]
@144  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, good. I just heard something that makes me believe we have a chance for freedom... if we're willing to seize it! Quickly, gather as many as you can in the performers' bunks! I'll meet you there.~ [OH92870]
@145  = ~Hey. I managed to get those items you asked for. You wouldn't believe the lengths I had to go to. Think duck feathers, ale, and a highly choreographed song and dance routine... but it'll be worth it if it all gets put to good use.~ [OH100690]
@146  = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>. An audience member donated this and asked that you use it in your next fight. Congratulations!~ [OH94549]
@147  = ~Someone who wishes to remain anonymous wanted you to have this and asked that you continue "kickin' arse and spillin' entrails." Enjoy!~ [zbpod9]
@148  = ~Wow, <CHARNAME>, you obviously have at least one rabid—not to mention EXTREMELY wealthy—fan. Just LOOK at what someone sent you today!~ [OH94551]
@149  = ~It's unbelievable the way these people fawn over you. I could bottle your sweat and sell it as an in-stand refreshment. Here's something from an INCREDIBLY devoted fan. Congratulations!~ [OH94552]
@150  = ~Psst! I set up that meetin' with the lieutenant. He's in the barracks. I can take you there if you like, or you can go on your own when you get around to it.~ [OH92333]
@151  = ~Please take me there now.~
@152  = ~I'll go on my own.~
@153  = ~Follow me.~ [OH92336]
@154  = ~As you wish. If we need to talk further, you know where to find me.~ [OH92711]
@155  = ~Oh, hello there, <CHARNAME>. If you're looking for Tartle, he's normally in the merchant area.~ [OH90975]
@156  = ~I actually came to talk to you.~
@157  = ~Thanks. I'll look for him there.~
@158  = ~Me? What for? Tartle's the one in charge.~ [OH90978]
@159  = ~What is it you do around here exactly?~
@160  = ~I'd like some information on the people who run this place.~
@161  = ~Then perhaps I'll seek him out after all. Please excuse me.~
@162  = ~Tartle likes to call it "grunt work." Basically, that's everything required to actually run the place—track the inventory, order supplies, arrange for the performer housing, see that their quarters are cleaned when they're killed, um, I mean, their services are no longer required. Also manage the guards, keep the cooks from killing each other... That sort of thing.~ [OH90982]
@163  = ~Sounds like you might have some good information on the people running this place.~
@164  = ~You're a slave, in other words. Help me plot a rebellion.~
@165  = ~I need to set up a meeting with the guard lieutenant you know.~
@166  = ~I've been thinking about your rebelling idea. I'm in.~
@167  = ~I need to go. Please excuse me.~
@168  = ~Who're you talkin' about?~ [OH90988]
@169  = ~Tartle.~
@170  = ~Dennaton.~
@171  = ~Dennaton's mercenaries.~
@172  = ~I prefer not to think of my cousin. He takes every opportunity to run me down. I'm sick of it!~ [OH90992]
@173  = ~Why does he treat you so poorly?~
@174  = ~How'd he get to be in charge?~
@175  = ~What of Dennaton?~
@176  = ~What about that band of mercenaries?~
@177  = ~He's an insecure runt, and for a good reason. He'd be nothing without me, and he knows it. He hasn't the interest or the discipline to properly run this place.~ [OH90998]
@178  = ~Runt? But you're a halfling too!~
@179  = ~So how'd he get to be in charge, then?~
@180  = ~Do you have time for more questions?~
@181  = ~You think all halflings are "runts"? You're wrong. All halflings are short, but there are runts even by halfling standards. Tartle's a full half-inch shorter than I am. Ever since we were children in Luiren, everyone made fun of him for being so short. Maybe that's why he's so intent on showing people what a "big man" he is now.~ [OH91002]
@182  = ~So, how'd he get to be in charge, then?~
@183  = ~A combination of bootlicking and backstabbing. Those qualities make him the perfect tool for Dennaton, luckily for him. He wouldn't last past the arena's introductory speeches otherwise.~ [OH91004]
@184  = ~So you two are slaves as well?~
@185  = ~Oh, yes. Don't let Tartle's arrogance fool you. He's in chains, same as we are. Not that he's without influence. His lips are so firmly affixed to Dennaton's backside that he generally gets his way. And he can certainly make life miserable for those he has it out for. I wouldn't cross him if I were you.~ [OH91006]
@186  = ~Now that I know you're a slave too, perhaps you could help me plot a rebellion?~
@187  = ~His word here is law. Cross him and your life will be very uncomfortable... or more likely, very short.~ [OH91008]
@188  = ~Yes, but who is he and where does he come from?~
@189  = ~And Tartle?~
@190  = ~I don't know much about him. Dennaton doesn't enter the performers' quarters often. Tartle's just about the only one with access to him.~ [OH91011]
@191  = ~He's a Red Wizard, I know that, and I gather he's somewhat influential in Thay. He has a VERY powerful backer, but I've no idea who—or what—that might be.~ [OH91012]
@192  = ~The Planar Hunters. They're the metaphorical sword in Dennaton's iron fist. Don't get me wrong. Dennaton's a competent wizard, but he'd have no chance of controlling the monsters and gladiators he brings here without the Hunters. But I've said too much already. Let's move on.~ [OH91013]
@193  = ~I'm gonna forget I heard that. And if you're smart, you'll forget you said it. Dennaton has eyes and ears everywhere. Watch yourself.~ [OH91014]
@194  = ~Tell me about the people who run this place.~
@195  = ~Certainly.~ [OH91017]
@196  = ~I'd like to know about the people who run this place.~
@197  = ~I've considered your idea for a rebellion. I'm in.~
@198  = ~What do we need to do for a rebellion to work?~
@199  = ~I need to find a few items: a wyrm tooth, a carrion crawler egg, and a scroll made from the skin of an ettin. Can you help me procure them?~
@200  = ~Not at the moment. Please excuse me.~
@201  = ~Hmm… That's quite an eclectic list, but I assume it's important for our plans, so I'll make every effort to get them. Give me a little while to round them up. Come talk to me in a bit.~ [OH93997]
@202  = ~Thanks for the help, but I also have something else I need to talk about.~
@203  = ~Right, I'll get started then. Please excuse me.~
@204  = ~Hmm… That's quite an eclectic list. Some of those things would be EXTREMELY difficult—not to mention expensive—to come up with. I'm sorry, but I can't help you.~ [OH94000]
@205  = ~Then let's talk about something else.~
@206  = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. How may I help you?~ [OH91025]
@207  = ~Tell me again what needs to be done for a rebellion to work.~
@208  = ~You can't right now. Excuse me.~
@209  = ~Psst! You asked earlier about plotting a rebellion. It got me thinking. It'd be tricky, but based on what you've shown thus far in the arena, you might just be able to pull it off.~ [OH91026]
@210  = ~I'm interested. Go on.~
@211  = ~How do I know you aren't setting me up?~
@212  = ~I'm really not interested anymore.~
@213  = ~Psst, <CHARNAME>. I want to ask you about something. We've all heard how you defeated Sarevok and saved Baldur's Gate. I admit I doubted it before. But your arena success makes me think the legend might actually be true. Are you interested in attaining your freedom once more?~ [zblank]
@214  = ~Sure.~
@215  = ~What's in it for you?~
@216  = ~I was at first, but I've changed my mind. This place isn't so bad. There's a... clarity here that's very attractive to me.~
@217  = ~Great! Then we're a team, on one condition. Tartle must not be harmed.~ [OH91034]
@218  = ~You'd protect your cousin, even after all he's done to you?~
@219  = ~It's a deal. Now what do we do?~
@220  = ~Sorry, but I can't promise that.~
@221  = ~He's still family. I need your assurance that no harm will come to him.~ [OH91038]
@222  = ~Uh, MY freedom when you overthrow Dennaton? There's something I need to find on the outside, but I need to GET outside first. But that's none of your concern. Are you interested?~ [OH91041]
@223  = ~I would have been once. No longer.~
@224  = ~Any rebellion will have to face Dennaton himself, his Planar Hunters, and the guards. Dennaton'll have to be killed, I fear—he's too invested in this place to let it go willingly. But we may be able to peel away his support.~ [OH91042]
@225  = ~I'm friendly with most of the guards. That doesn't mean they'll just lay down their arms for me, of course, but I CAN get you a meeting with one of the lieutenants. Convince him to support the rebellion and his subordinates will too. That'll take a very smooth tongue or more coin than Dennaton's paying to keep them loyal.~ [OH91043]
@226  = ~As for the Planar Hunters, the Winged is loyal to Dennaton despite all her grumbling. And she has a tight grip on her people. It'd be best to deal with them before an uprising begins. I've no solid idea how you'd do that, but I've an inkling where you might start.~ [OH91044]
@227  = ~The Hunters' quarters are upstairs. I've never been allowed up myself, but the first step is getting to the stairway. Unfortunately, the only way through is to knock and then convince the guard that opens the eye slit to let you through. Not easy. The only ones they ever let through are the Nosers.~ [OH91045]
@228  = ~Nosers?~
@229  = ~No one else is allowed through? Really?~
@230  = ~The Nosers are the Planar Hunters' slaves. Tartle hates them because he has no control over them, and they all know it. He thinks they look down their noses at him—that's how they got the nickname. They're easy to distinguish from the other slaves. They wear bright-colored outfits that let the door guard differentiate them from others in the gloom.~ [OH91048]
@231  = ~Right, so absolutely no one else is allowed through?~
@232  = ~Go on.~
@233  = ~Actually, that's not true. My cousin, Tartle, is allowed through. He has his own key, so he doesn't have to knock. He's the only one other than the Nosers.~ [OH91051]
@234  = ~Who are the Nosers?~
@235  = ~Once you're on the stairs, be careful. Word is the way up is littered with traps of all kinds. Only the very crafty—or very lucky—will get through unscathed. After that, you'll need to live on your own wits.~ [OH91053]
@236  = ~If I'm to battle the Planar Hunters, I'll need everything you know about them.~
@237  = ~Thanks. But I need to talk about other things.~
@238  = ~Discretion is called for. I'll bide my time until the right opportunity presents itself, then let you know when everything's set up. Until then, go about your business normally.~ [OH91058]
@239  = ~All right. In the meantime, I need as much information as you've got on the Planar Hunters.~
@240  = ~Thanks, but there are other things I need to know.~
@241  = ~Right. I'll get started then.~
@242  = ~The Winged's band has six members: Dormamus, Thassk Kun, Pol Pyrrus, Joker, Bannor Kaxazel, and the Winged herself.~ [OH91062]
@243  = ~Tell me about the Winged.~
@244  = ~What do you know about Dormamus?~
@245  = ~Thassk Kun. What can you tell me about him?~
@246  = ~Give me everything you know about Pol Pyrrus.~
@247  = ~Joker's the bard, yes? Tell me about her.~
@248  = ~Bannor Kaxazel. What's his story?~
@249  = ~Forget the Hunters. There's something else I want to know about.~
@250  = ~The Winged is the most guarded of the group. She rarely speaks to anyone except Dennaton and her crew. I know she's a veteran of the infamous Blood War and was involved in some of its heaviest fighting. She's incredibly disciplined and extremely dangerous.~ [OH91070]
@251  = ~And Dormamus?~
@252  = ~And Thassk Kun?~
@253  = ~And Pol Pyrrus?~
@254  = ~And Joker?~
@255  = ~And Bannor Kaxazel?~
@256  = ~Let's talk now about something else.~
@257  = ~An irredeemably vile creature. Dormamus, or the Grand Vizier of the Thayan Pits, as he makes us call him, is an efreeti. He's the sort of person who enjoys his job so much he never has to work. He's capricious, cruel, and in love with the money and power that comes from subduing and imprisoning others.~ [OH91078]
@258  = ~And the Winged?~
@259  = ~Thassk Kun and Pol Pyrrus despise each other. I gather they were on opposite sides of a war several years ago. Pyrrus delights in reminding Thassk who was on the losing side. Thassk has some dirt on Pyrrus. I'm not sure what it is, but I've seen Thassk spin Pyrrus around to the point of spitting blood. Thassk is a fire salamander, by the way.~ [OH91079]
@260  = ~Like I said, he hates Thassk Kun. I can't add much to what I already told you, other than that Pyrrus is a Red Wizard and fanatical adherent to Kossuth.~ [OH94016]
@261  = ~Pyrrus is a Red Wizard and a fanatical adherent to Kossuth. He and Thassk Kun positively HATE each other. From what I gather, they were on opposite sides of a war several years ago. Pyrrus never misses an opportunity to remind Thassk he was on the losing side. But Thassk has some dirt on Pyrrus. I'm not sure what it is, but I've seen Thassk spin Pyrrus around to the point of spitting blood.~ [OH91080]
@262  = ~I just told you he hates Pyrrus. The only thing I can really add is that Thassk is a fire salamander.~ [OH94017]
@263  = ~Ah, Joker. The most mercurial of the bunch, and also the friendliest. She slums around down here every so often. She loves to drink and is always looking for new and exotic ales. Her love of drinking has given her common cause with Voghiln. I've seen the two of them together quite a bit.~ [OH91081]
@264  = ~One word: odd. He's an adamantine golem with a mind of his own. Rumor has it he was once a supremely powerful wizard who cheated death by installing his mind in the golem's body as his own lay dying. If it's true, most of his powers were lost in the transition. Now he just smashes things, as you'd expect from an adamantine golem.~ [OH91082]
@265  = ~Well, as I said, Thassk Kun and Pol Pyrrus HATE each other. Beyond that, Thassk is a fire salamander.~
@266  = ~Well, as I said, Pol Pyrrus and Thassk Kun HATE each other. Beyond that, Pyrrus is a Red Wizard and fanatical adherent to Kossuth.~
@267  = ~You don't. And I don't know of any reasonable way to prove myself to you. At the same time, you have no way to prove YOU weren't setting ME up when you asked last time. I wouldn't put that past Dennaton, but chances for freedom are few and far between down here. Are you in?~ [OH91085]
@268  = ~A shame. Well, I'm clearly going nowhere soon. Seek me out if you change your mind.~ [OH91086]
@269  = ~I still want to talk to you.~
@270  = ~I'll keep it in mind. Excuse me.~
@271  = ~You don't. The alternative is fighting until you die in the pits. Now are you in?~ [OH91089]
@272  = ~There's not as many here as I'd hoped, but we can't afford to wait any longer. Dennaton's in the arena overseeing a fight, but he won't be long.~ [OH92872]
@273  = ~I really think we should wait on backup.~
@274  = ~Is rebelling a good idea?~
@275  = ~What do you suggest?~
@276  = ~That's not a good idea. The Planar Hunters have disappeared. Ha. Hopefully, they're gone forever, but we can't count on that. Dennaton's without his muscle. We must strike now!~ [OH92881]
@277  = ~I can't believe it! Baeloth's vanquisher wants to be a gladiator for life? Who are you, Haximus? We have to rebel now if any of us are ever to be free!~ [OH92888]
@278  = ~Remember the bargain we struck. Tartle is not to be harmed.~ [OH92889]
@279  = ~He won't be, I promise.~
@280  = ~I'll do what I can.~
@281  = ~That deal was made yesterday. If he gets in my way today, he's finished.~
@282  = ~Before we proceed, please, I beg you—if you find Tartle, do not harm him.~ [OH92892]
@283  = ~You'd save him even after the damage he's done to you?~
@284  = ~I will do as you ask.~
@285  = ~If he stays out of my way, he'll be fine.~
@286  = ~He's still my blood. I must protect him. Please, don't harm him.~ [OH92894]
@287  = ~If he gets in my way, he's a dead halfling.~
/* removing references to baeloth's pits - BHAALSPAWN might be more suitable here */
@288  = ~Then I suppose I should be thankful that I struck the deal with our friend here! The Hero of Baldur's Gate is the logical choice to lead this uprising.~ [OH92900]
@289  = ~Thank you! We should head to the barracks immediately. With luck, we can take the guards by surprise and eliminate them before they know what's happening.~ [OH92901]
@290  = ~No. We should strike Dennaton first.~
@291  = ~What about Leokas? I paid him to aid us in this uprising.~
@292  = ~I need to finish something before we play our hand.~
@293  = ~That'll have to do. All right then, we should head to the barracks. With any luck, we can take the guards by surprise and eliminate them before they know what hit them!~ [OH92903]
@294  = ~I disagree. We should strike at Dennaton first.~
@295  = ~Wait. I need to finish something before we reveal our hand.~
@296  = ~Let's go! Start the uprising!~
@297  = ~That wasn't the deal! You said you wouldn't harm Tartle!~ [OH92904]
@298  = ~Alright, I'll keep my word.~
@299  = ~I thought we'd sorted this out.~
@300  = ~I said I'll do what I can.~
@301  = ~If Tartle stays out of the way, he'll live. If he doesn't, he will die. It's that simple.~
@302  = ~Not good enough! You must guarantee Tartle's safety if I'm to help you!~ [OH92907]
@303  = ~Very well. I'll not harm him.~
@304  = ~I'll try to save him. I can't promise more than that.~
@305  = ~Let me be blunt: If Tartle stays away from me, he'll live. If he tries to stop me, he dies. Got it?~
@306  = ~If Tartle is harmed, you'd best pray we never cross paths again. For now, it seems I've little choice but to find him before you.~ [OH92910]
@307  = ~Yes, I get the picture. I am left to my own devices when it comes to protecting my cousin.~ [OH92916]
@308  = ~I suggest we head to the barracks. If we're lucky, we can eliminate the guards before they realize what's happening.~ [OH92917]
@309  = ~No. We hit Dennaton first.~
@310  = ~There's something I must finish before we play our hand.~
@311  = ~Let the uprising begin!~
@312  = ~Confrontin' Dennaton while leaving dozens o' guards behind us isn't smart. We'd be surrounded.~ [OH92918]
@313  = ~You may be right. Give me a moment. I need to finish something before we make our move.~
@314  = ~Let the rebellion begin!~
@315  = ~I obviously knew that you two had spoken, but I did not realize you had come to an agreement. It's too late to coordinate with him now. We will have to keep a lookout for him as we go and then hope he keeps his word.~ [OH92919]
@316  = ~All right. Give me a moment. I need to finish something before we begin our assault.~
@317  = ~Very well. Let's have ourselves an uprising!~
@318  = ~Do as you must, but do not tarry long! Our opportunity may disappear at any moment!~ [OH92920]
@319  = ~That's the spirit! Let's go! IN ARVOREEN'S NAME, DEATH TO DENNATON!~ [OH92927]
@320  = ~Finally! I was beginning to think you'd had a change of heart! Are you ready?~ [OH92928]
@321  = ~Not quite. I need to finish something before we make our move.~
@322  = ~I'm beyond ready. DEATH TO DENNATON!~
@323  = ~Oh, shut it, you ignorant cretin! Do you really think this door will stop us?~ [OH92940]
@324  = ~Look at that. Who'd have thought a swift kick to the frame would pop the door open? I've done my part, <CHARNAME>. I'll leave the rest to you!~ [OH92941]
@325  = ~Hit the switch on the other side of this wall to open the training room doors!~
@326  = ~All right, everyone, no gawking. Quickly, form a line. We'll make our stand here if need be.~ [OH94302]
@327  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, there you are! Just wait till you see this! The vault's been blown open! I haven't had a chance to investigate, but there's a body inside. I think it's Brother Ellraish. You may want to check it out.~ [OH94303]
@328  = ~Be quick about it, though. The matches are still going, but it's only a matter of time before Dennaton learns what we've done.~ [OH94304]
@329  = ~Are you ready to face Dennaton?~ [OH92962]
@330  = ~Absolutely.~
@331  = ~You aren't coming with me?~
@332  = ~I need to rest for a bit. Keep an eye out for guards and alert me if someone's coming.~
@333  = ~No. I need time to prepare.~
@334  = ~Excellent! We'll hold this position to ensure you aren't attacked from behind. The matches are nearly over. You must act quickly.~ [OH92965]
@335  = ~News of our uprising must have reached the upper chambers by now. More guards will be coming. We'll hold this position to ensure you aren't attacked from behind. Are you ready?~ [OH92966]
@336  = ~As ready as I'll ever be.~
@337  = ~Not quite. I still need to prepare.~
@338  = ~Be quick. We haven't much time left.~ [OH92967]
@339  = ~Excellent. Let's get you—uh oh! Sounds like the matches are nearing an end. You'll have to act quickly to catch Dennaton. Let's go!~ [OH92968]
@340  = ~That's it? They're dead? The Winged and the Planar Hunters are really dead? I... I can't believe it!~ [OH100616]
@341  = ~I don't see Dennaton among the dead. He must have run. Without his Hunters, he's no longer a threat to us or anyone else.~ [OH100627]
@342  = ~Would that I could say the same for you! Tartle, my cousin, is dead, slain by your hand!~ [OH100628]
@343  = ~I tried to save him, Brodle. He wouldn't listen to reason.~
@344  = ~I did what I had to do.~
@345  = ~I freed you, and you want to whine about your cousin?~
@346  = ~And you spared my cousin, Tartle. That couldn't have been easy. Thank you for your restraint. Farewell.~ [OH100629]
@347  = ~I care nothing for your excuses, <CHARNAME>! You have what you wanted. Go now and pray I'm never in a position to pay you back.~ [OH100630]
@348  = ~Oh, by Tymora's dice, give it a rest already...~ [OH90524]
@349  = ~I could fry you and your friends a dozen ways. Stay out of the kitchen.~
@350  = ~You have no business in the kitchen. Get out of here, now.~
@351  = ~Move! You're in the way.~
@352  = ~Why are you still here? Go away before I get angry.~
@353  = ~What did I tell you? Get out!~
@354  = ~Can I have a bit of the soup too, boss?~
@355  = ~Cook's waiting on that mushroom chunk. Don't disappoint him.~
@356  = ~Cook doesn't mind you so much. Just don't bother him.~
@357  = ~Move. You're not needed here.~
@358  = ~Out! Out of here, now!~
@359  = ~...~
@360  = ~Clangeddin's beard, look at this! All me work ruined by you donkeys! Do y'have any idea what it takes to make braised lobster arabel with broccoli root cream and shellfish vinaigrette? THAT WAS PURE ART!~
@361  = ~Where is that peanut-sized rat? Scurried off to his hole, most like! TARTLE, YOU VERMIN, COME AND FACE ME! ME LOBSTER ARABEL WILL BE AVENGED!~
@362  = ~Oh, here comes another lamb fer the slaughter. What do y'want?~
@363  = ~Who are you?~
@364  = ~What is this place?~
@365  = ~How can we get out of here?~
@366  = ~Never mind.~
@367  = ~I'm the bleedin' chef. Wasn't fer me, ye'd have nothin' GOOD to eat. None of ye would, the hunters upstairs or the slaves below.~
@368  = ~I best never find ye lingering around me kitchen, poking in me pots, complaining about yer food... Even look at me crossways and ye'll answer to him.~
@369  = ~Anythin' else?~
@370  = ~That's all.~
@371  = ~It's yer world now. Ye sleep in yer bunk, eat what I cook, and fight fer yer life. If ye're good an' lucky, y'might keep it a while.~
@372  = ~The kitchen an' banquet hall are mine. Upstairs is the Hunters'. All that goes up there is food and drink and the bloody Nosers.~
@373  = ~If y'want to poke about, go see the merchants or the clerics. Better yet, keep to the lounge or trainin' hall. And the arena, of course.~
@374  = ~Ye don't, that's how.~
@375  = ~Anything else y'want to ask, or can I get back to work now?~
@376  = ~I'm busy. What do y'want?~
@377  = ~I have some questions.~
@378  = ~Tartle's feeding me nothing but rotten food. May I have something to eat?~
@379  = ~Make it quick.~
@380  = ~Sounds like somethin' the wretched weasel'd do. Here, take this. I'll make sure y'get proper food from now on. I'll not accept anything but the best served 'round here. Could reflect poorly on me skills.~
@381  = ~I'll remember this gesture. Bless you.~
@382  = ~I should pay you for this. ~
@383  = ~Glad I could help you preserve your reputation.~
@384  = ~Get out. I've work to do.~
@385  = ~Hey! Get over here! I want to talk wi' ye.~
@386  = ~Y'want a little boost on yer plate before yer next fight? There's something y'can do fer me.~
@387  = ~I don't do favors for the likes of you.~
@388  = ~I'll take any advantage I can get.~
@389  = ~I'm doing just fine in the arena. But I might be willing to do you a favor.~
@390  = ~Suit yerself; I'll ask another one of yer sad bunch. I've a mind t' feed ye wyvern slop fer the next week. Count yerself lucky I'm proud of what I serve here.~
@391  = ~Listen up. What I tell ye stays between us.~
@392  = ~Blab about it and I'll turn your mind into sausage.~
@393  = ~I want ye to get me a piece—doesn't have to be a big one... just the size of me thumb, say—~
@394  = ~—a piece o' that walkin' mushroom in the market.~
@395  = ~The Concocter? That's terrible! What did it do to you?~
@396  = ~What would you want with that? Disgusting.~
@397  = ~Hmm... Tasty. I like mushroom too.~
@398  = ~It'll grow back. Ye've done worse in the arena.~
@399  = ~Y'obviously haven't tasted myconid flesh.~
@400  = ~Exactly! Glad t' find another epicurean in this place, finally.~
@401  = ~A while back, somebody gave me a few pieces of myconid t' cook. They meant it as a joke. But I simmered slivers in a light stock a full day, added a bit o' salt, and that was it. Best soup I ever tasted.~
@402  = ~Get some o' that giant mushroom an' bring it to me. I can be quite helpful t' those who do me a service.~
@403  = ~Ferget it. I wouldn't waste it on ye.~
@404  = ~Y'better have a good reason fer disturbing me.~
@405  = ~You said earlier there was something I could do for you.~
@406  = ~I have a piece of the Concocter.~
@407  = ~You should know your sous-chefs have asked me to poison you.~
@408  = ~I'm looking for a "special" ingredient for a drink I'd like to make.~
@409  = ~I'd like to ask you something.~
@410  = ~Changed yer mind, have ye? Listen up, this stays between us.~
@411  = ~Y'do? Bring it here!~
@412  = ~Here it is.~
@413  = ~First, I want your assurance I'll get some of that soup when it's ready.~
@414  = ~Mmmm, smell that! Hard to believe such an amazing scent comes from such an 'orrible creature.~
@415  = ~Here, I promised y'these. Eat one before yer next fight. It'll give ye a mighty edge.~
@416  = ~Fine. But I'm not making it just now. Don't have time to enjoy it, keepin' you performers fed. Ye'll get yer taste once this tournament is done, y'have me word. Now give me the myconid.~
@417  = ~Is that so? Ye ingrate monkeys! Did y'really think ye'd get away wi' this?~
@418  = ~I should just cook ye up and see what halfling-gnome soup tastes like. Wait till Dennaton hears about this. Ye'll wish I had!~
@419  = ~And ye, thanks for coming to me wi' this. I suppose I'm in yer debt now.~
@420  = ~So y'fancy yerself an innkeeper now?  Why would a slave want to make drinks?~
@421  = ~It's better you don't know the details.~
@422  = ~I helped you once. Now I need you to help me.~
@423  = ~It's a surprise for one of the Planar Hunters.~
@424  = ~I see... What is this ingredient y'need?~
@425  = ~Poison.~
@426  = ~Never mind. Forget I brought it up.~
@427  = ~A dwarf always pays his debts. What's this ingredient ye're looking for?~
@428  = ~Some sort of poison that could kill or incapacitate a man or woman.~
@429  = ~Ye've got it in fer one of the Winged's thugs, have ye? I like the sound of that. What's this ingredient y'need?~
@430  = ~Some sort of poison.~
@431  = ~Not thinking of poisoning me, are ye? Hah! Wouldn't think so! Who'd feed ye?~
@432  = ~Some people are deathly allergic to funguswood... but fer the average person, a healthy dose of rat poison should do the trick. There's some in the cupboard. Help yerself.~
@433  = ~Damn. I was enjoying where this conversation was headed. Come back around if y'have a change of heart.~
@434  = ~Stop watching the stew! It'll be ready soon enough.~
@435  = ~Ye didn't put anything in there, did ye? (The cook dips his spoon in the stew, swirls it around, then brings the spoon to his lips...)~
@436  = ~Hmm. That's odd. Tastes a bit like... mushroom.~
@437  = ~Come here and taste this! (The cook pushes his spoon towards his bodyguard.)~
@438  = ~Hey. No talking to the help. They've pots to clean, ye know.~
@439  = ~Quit yammerin' and get back to work. Do y'want to feel me spoon on the back of yer heads again?~
@440  = ~Y-you, you're a big-headed brute, aren't you, Timmoth? Why don't you assist me, then? All you do is stand there and pass judgment. No one's asking you to stay; you're free to leave our shrine if you don't like it.~
@441  = ~Garagos has nothing to do with it, you savage. You know full well this is Dennaton's doing. Him and the one who puts up the gold for this barbaric spectacle.~
@442  = ~You mindless brute! Theses arenas make mockeries of the field of battle! No true soldier takes pride in fighting in a cage. It's nothing more than animals going at each other's throats. I'd not put a foot in there.~
@443  = ~Timmoth, you—you come here, and—~
@444  = ~You are a liar and an imbecile, Laris. Dorn Graybrook was never here, and no one is ever freed from this place. Besides, everyone knows Graybrook is one of Tempus's greatest warriors.~
@445  = ~An axe in the back?~
@446  = ~Welcome is not the right word, given the circumstances. I'm sorry to see another free <PRO_MANWOMAN> brought to this dreadful place.~
@447  = ~Garagos has nothing to do with it, you savage. You know full well this is the work of Dennaton, him and the one who supplies the gold for this barbaric spectacle.~
@448  = ~Mindless brute! Theses arenas mock the field of battle! No true soldier would take pride in fighting in such a cage. It's nothing more than animals, going at each other's throats. I'll not put a foot in there.~
@449  = ~Thank you, Molzahn. Tell me, newcomer, whom do you march with in battle? Whom is it you fight for? Are you a knight of Tempus, the true god of war?~
@450  = ~Tempus is useless to me. I have plenty of success in battle without praying to him.~
@451  = ~Tempus? That feeble excuse for a deity? He is the Usurper. Glory be to Garagos, may he see us bathe in the blood of thousands slain in battle.~
@452  = ~No, I put my faith in another god.~
@453  = ~There is nothing but war, sister, no one but Tempus. May his enemies' blood drip from his blade for all eternity.~
@454  = ~USELESS? No one, you hear me, NO ONE can best the soldiers of Tempus in skill and tactics in battle.~
@455  = ~Mind your own business, Molzahn. I can speak very well for myself. Now, if your intent, <CHARNAME>, is to slander, then I see no point in pursuing discussion with you. Molzahn, you talk to <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@456  = ~Useless? Is THAT what you think? No one, you hear me, NO ONE can best the soldiers of Tempus on the battlefield. If your intent is to slander, <CHARNAME>, then I see no point in pursuing my discussion with you. Molzahn, you talk to <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@457  = ~Not you too! You and Laris are misguided. Garagos's followers fight like a mindless gibberlings. No skill, no tactics. That is NOT how you win wars.~
@458  = ~I don't need you to speak for me, Molzahn. Sir Timmoth's bluster means little to me. ~
@459  = ~Nor to me. I've wounds in need of healing. Can you help me?~
@460  = ~As he's in this place, I assume he's earned the right to a little bluster. But enough of him—what services does your temple provide?~
@461  = ~I don't want to discuss Timmoth. You said someone else besides Dennaton was behind this place?~
@462  = ~Yes, let's get to more serious matters. I found this gauntlet and was wondering if you could decipher the writing inscribed upon it.~
@463  = ~I'll be going.~
@464  = ~Not you too! You and Laris are misguided. Garagos's followers fight on the battlefield like a mindless swarm of gibberlings. No skill, no tactics. That is NOT how you win wars.~
@465  = ~My wounds would seem to support your claim. Are you able to heal them?~
@466  = ~You'd know better than I. Can I see your temple services?~
@467  = ~Let's talk of something else. You said someone besides Dennaton was behind this place?~
@468  = ~Let's get to more serious matters. I found this gauntlet and was wondering if you could decipher the writing inscribed upon it.~
@469  = ~On this, if nothing else, Sir Timmoth and I would agree: You would be well served to put your faith in Tempus. In this world of constant struggle, skill and tactics will win the day, every time.~
@470  = ~Mind your own business, Molzahn. I can deal with Sir Timmoth very well by myself.~
@471  = ~Can you heal my wounds?~

@477  = ~Did you hear that, Sir Timmoth? Another member of our order has arrived. Didn't they say they brought only the land's best warriors here? NO ONE can best the battlefield skills of Tempus's soldiers!~
@478  = ~Still your tongue, Molzahn. To me, Sir Timmoth's bluster is as water off a duck's back.~
@479  = ~A sensible approach. Now, to more important matters. I've wounds that need tending. Can you help me?~
@480  = ~Enough talk of Timmoth. I would see your temple services.~
@481  = ~I would speak to you of other things. You said someone else besides Dennaton was behind this place?~
@482  = ~All glory to Tempus! Another member of our order has arrived. Dennaton says he brings only the land's best warriors here, and this is the proof of it. NO ONE can best Tempus's soldiers on the battlefield!~
@483  = ~Left untended, I've some wounds that would make a compelling argument to the contrary. Can you help me?~
@484  = ~It's not the battlefield I wish to discuss. You said someone besides Dennaton was behind this place?~
@485  = ~A question for you, Curell: I've acquired this gauntlet. Can you decipher the writing inscribed upon it?~
@486  = ~Molzahn does the healing, not I.~
@487  = ~You said someone else besides Dennaton was behind this place?~
@488  = ~Ah. Well, perhaps there's something else you can help me with. This gauntlet—can you decipher the inscription?~
@489  = ~You must speak with Molzahn about that. I don't handle the mercantile side of the shrine's operations.~
@490  = ~Can you help me with my wounds?~
@491  = ~Well, perhaps there's something else you can help me with. This gauntlet—can you decipher the inscription?~
@492  = ~Yes, it's true. Dennaton is not this arena's ultimate patron, though he certainly enjoys playing the role. We do not know his sponsor's name. Whoever they are, they must be extremely powerful.~
@493  = ~Interesting. On a different topic, can I see your temple services?~
@494  = ~Intriguing. Another question for you: I've acquired this gauntlet. Can you decipher the writing inscribed upon it?~
@495  = ~Amazing! The writing is Celestial. Most of it states the core tenets of Torm. This here, for instance: "Champion the weak and defenseless." This part says, "Stand ever alert against corruption."~
@496  = ~It speaks specifically of "the fourfold duties" but doesn't describe them. I suppose it's assumed the gauntlet's owner would know them already.~
@497  = ~Thanks for the translation. On a completely different note, can you heal my wounds?~
@498  = ~Ah yes, 'tis the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who called Tempus useless. Then what must I, his humble servant, be to you? At best, unworthy of your time. Goodbye.~
@499  = ~It is good to see you again, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. Let us chant Tempus's March together.~
@500  = ~Later. First, I must deal with my wounds.~
@501  = ~In a moment. First, I'd like to know about this person you mentioned—the one behind this place? It's not Dennaton?~
@502  = ~I've acquired this gauntlet and was wondering if you could decipher the inscription.~
@503  = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. May each of your triumphs bring you closer to Tempus. What can I do for you?~
@504  = ~This is a time for heroes, <CHARNAME>. Tempus stands with those who fight honorably. Take these gifts, and strike true.~
@505  = ~Tempus guide your blades.~
@506  = ~This savage and I—~
@507  = ~Hmm... For once you are right, Molzahn. "Laris" and I rarely see eye to eye, but in this we are agreed. Tempus blesses those who fight honorably, and your actions today are worthy in his sight.~
@508  = ~We will fight by your side. It is time to strike a blow against Dennaton!~
@509  = ~We are ready! Let us proceed to the arena and strike the final blow! ~
@510  = ~Do you have business with Master Dormamus? He's out at the moment.~
@511  = ~"Swordfish."~
@512  = ~Dormamus invited me to visit his beautiful quarters anytime, even if he's absent.~
@513  = ~Dormamus asked me to get something from his room. I'll let him know you wouldn't let me in.~
@514  = ~I'll come back.~
@515  = ~Come in, please. Make yourself comfortable.~

@529  = ~I hope the cook makes his famous mushroom soup again soon.~
@530  = ~Would you like to brush my hair?~
@531  = ~The silk on these cushions is itchy.~
@532  = ~I mean, "OUR" wealth, of course. This is a partnership. I need you and you, me. So long as you perform and entertain our audience, you will live a life of comfort, even opulence.~ [OH90535]
@533  = ~You expect us to kill each other for you and your patrons' amusement?~
@534  = ~I like comfort and opulence. I like freedom even more.~
@535  = ~Forget it. I'm not going through this again!~

@538  = ~I'll not play your pathetic game, Dennaton! I decide my own fate!~
@539  = ~What, no nickname for me?~
@540  = ~Let me be clear, Dennaton. I'll fight and I'll kill. It's what I do, but if the coin's not good enough, I'll butcher and stew you in a pot of your own gravy!~
@541  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, don't be so naïve. Fighting for a king, country, god, or even an ideal is still fighting for a cause that isn't you. At least this way you get rich in the process.~ [OH90566]
@542  = ~A feeble justification. I'll hear no more of your lies.~
@543  = ~Hmm... We shall see.~
@544  = ~I'd better.~
@545  = ~You don't have to like it, <CHARNAME>. You just have to fight, and if you don't? Well, then you shall be killed. A shame to lose one of your talent, but the show will go on.~ [OH90570]

@546  = ~Of course you shall have one! How about "The Ravager"? No, no, no, no... "Infinite Desolation"? No, I don't like that... Of course! You are "The Hero of Baldur's Gate"!~ [ZBPOD1]
@547  = ~Oh, you'll find the money more than sufficient, don't you worry about that. You just keep them coming back for more.~ [OH90592]

@549  = ~In what is sure to be little more than an exhibition, the new challenger will face several orcs captured in the wilds near Nethra. They SEEMED ferocious at the time, but look at them cower now that their challenger has been named!~ [OH94509]
@550  = ~Before we begin, <CHARNAME>, is there anything you'd like to say to the audience?~ [OH94510]
@551  = ~These foul beasts once committed unspeakable acts of cruelty upon the civilized people of Faerûn. Today, I enact justice in the name of all their innocent victims!~
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pits */
@552  = ~This arena is a joke. Let's get this over with, Dennaton!~
@553  = ~You expect me to entertain you, yet I have only the most basic of weaponry. Can a chef make a soufleé with only a firepit? Can a painter create a masterpiece with only one color? A symphony of violence requires many instruments.~
@554  = ~Not particularly.~
@555  = ~Why should I address these peasants? To gaze upon my magnificence is more than they deserve!~
@556  = ~We shall sleep better tonight, knowing there are heroes in this world. The time has come! Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94516]

@558  = ~My friends, our fledgling composer needs a patron. Will any of you help <PRO_HIMHER> make sweet music for you? For now, we shall let <PRO_HIMHER> demonstrate <PRO_HISHER> talent by hearing the tune <PRO_HESHE> plays with the instruments at hand! Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94518]
@559  = ~Inspiring stuff, <CHARNAME>. Very well, then. Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94519]
@560  = ~Listen to the boos! So raucous! So beautiful! The applause will be thunderous the day you are brought low! Perhaps today? Let's find out! Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94520]

@562  = ~This challenger is entirely homegrown. There's not a craven orc in the bunch! They're the top gladiatorial team out of Raskilov's Academy of Might from right here in Thay. I give you "Raskilov's Ragers!"~ [OH94042]
@563  = ~Everyone, please settle down and return to your seats! I'm afraid we can't pay out the bets on the last match, as it was interfered with. All wagers will be pushed to the next one!~ [OH94057]
@564  = ~In the meantime, grab another ale or leg of mutton while we do some slight restaging. Our food vendors are coming down the aisles now!~ [OH94059]
@565  = ~As for you "performers," let this be a lesson to you. There will be no changes to the script, and the script is this: You fight. Fight well, and you live. Fight poorly, you die. It's hardly original, but it's a crowd-pleaser.~ [OH94061]
@566  = ~*ahem* Attention, everyone! We are ready once more for today's main event. We've decided to keep what remains of "Raskilov's Ragers," and we're throwing in some minotaurs to help them out!~ [OH94062]
@567  = ~Before we start, <CHARNAME>, would you like to address your adoring fans?~ [OH94064]
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pits */
@568  = ~I am a humble <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I scraped by as best I could in Baldur's Gate. Faced with trained gladiators, I only hope I last long enough to provide the entertainment you deserve.~
@569  = ~Really, Dennaton? You claim to provide entertainment available nowhere else. This fight will be over in seconds, and you know it.~
@570  = ~I destroyed some orcs for your amusement—these gladiators will be no different. But you, my people, deserve more! Give me the proper tools, and I swear the front row will drip red with blood!~
@571  = ~Not at all.~
@572  = ~Thayan gladiators? Ha! A nation of weaklings! No Thayan can stand against me!~

@579  = ~Speaking of clawing, our next challengers hail from the marshes of Chult. It takes more than just a scaly hide and forked tongue to reach the top of the lizardman heap, and this tribal chieftain did it quicker than most. Throw in his elite guard, and it's sure to be hiss-sterical!~ [OH94126]
@580  = ~But before we begin—<CHARNAME>, is there anything you'd like to say to your adoring fans?~ [OH94127]
@581  = ~The noble savage. A worthy foe. I am honored to battle such an adversary. I trust our esteemed guests will find some thrill in the contest.~
@582  = ~This is shameful! Yet another hopelessly lopsided match fobbed off as entertainment. You're bilking these people out of their hard-earned coin!~
@583  = ~Today, you will see one lizard at a time skewered—but two at a time would be better. I need proper weaponry! Come on, people! A potter cannot create vases without clay!~
@584  = ~Nothing they'd care to hear.~
@585  = ~A lion doesn't address sheep.~
@586  = ~Noble savages indeed. Today's battle pits nature against civilization. Let us see which will prove the stronger. Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94137]
@587  = ~A valid point, <CHARNAME>. If the audience doesn't get their money's worth from this fight, perhaps I'll use your winnings to refund their tickets... IF you win. Now, to arms!~ [OH94139]
@588  = ~Who can resist the earnest entreaties of someone who wants nothing more than to entertain us? Be generous—help <PRO_HIMHER> help you! Now, without further ado, combatants! To arms!~ [OH94141]
@589  = ~You are a warrior of few words. If that's all you've got, then it's time to fight. Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94142]
@590  = ~Ah, yes, my patrons. Let your displeasure shower down upon our villain. Perhaps the Chultan savages will lay <PRO_HIMHER> low. Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94144]
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pits - voiced line needs to be altered, cut after 'talk of the arena' */
@591  = ~Attention, honored guests! Prepare to be amazed. Prepare to be HORRIFIED! Once again, I give you a warrior whose victories are the talk of the arena. Everyone, let's give a round of applause to the Hero of Baldur's Gate, <CHARNAME>!~ [ZBPOD3]
@592  = ~These next creatures were pulled from the mines of Mirabar! Some would have you believe such creatures do not exist—that they are only stories invented to frighten children. Today, you will see that they are very real indeed! Ladies and gentlemen, I present for your amusement—for your horror—a pack of rabid UMBER HULKS!~ [OH94198]
@593  = ~Before we begin, <CHARNAME>, have you any words for the audience?~ [OH94199]
@594  = ~Fear not, good people. As nightmares are banished by the light, so shall these creatures be banished by my might.~
@595  = ~Dennaton, you disgusting piece of filth! You'd not last ten seconds in this arena!~
@596  = ~At last, I face creatures capable of spilling the kind of blood you want. But imagine how much greater a spectacle you'd witness had I better weapons! You shall have a river of blood, but I yearn to give you an ocean!~
@597  = ~Don't think so.~
@598  = ~These pathetic creatures will fall before me. People of Thay, lock your doors and hide your children. I give nightmares nightmares!~
@599  = ~Courageous, and a poet to boot! Come, my patrons, show your champion support once more! Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94205]
@600  = ~You may be right. But the question that matters is how long YOU will last. Combatants, to arms!~ [OH94206]

@859  = ~Tell me, Dennaton, do the people here know you and Szass Tam conspire to eliminate a tharchion and elevate you in his place?~
@860  = ~All of you should know this arena is through. You will witness the final battle to occur here. This time, the prize is freedom—not just for me, but for all those below. And my final opponent is Dennaton!~
@861  = ~I hope none of you bought a lifetime membership to this arena. When I gut this pig, the pits will be out of business.~
@862  = ~Listen to me, scum! I'm a generous <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I'll give you exactly as much time as it takes to kill Dennaton to flee. Anyone here after I'm finished will join him in the grave!~
@863  = ~Such pathetic lies will not save you, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH100561]
@864  = ~Lies? It's all here in this journal.~
@865  = ~Where did you get that?! I mean—I've never seen that journal in my entire life! It's a forgery!~ [OH100562]
@866  = ~No, my adoring patrons, please! I would NEVER conspire against a tharchion! Do not believe the lies of a desperate <PRO_MANWOMAN>!~ [OH100563]
@867  = ~When you're gone, Dennaton, I shall release this journal. I will destroy your body, your name, your reputation—everything that's ever mattered to you.~
@868  = ~It is no forgery, Dennaton, but it IS the work of a fraud.~
@869  = ~You know better than that, Dennaton, but I suppose it doesn't matter to you. Things like journals and reputations mean little to the dead.~
@870  = ~A pretty speech, but words are of little consequence here.~ [OH100564]
@871  = ~Tell me, how did you coordinate this little rebellion? Who helped you?~ [OH100565]
@872  = ~Trying to stall, Dennaton? It won't work.~
@873  = ~Brodle helped me.~
@874  = ~I couldn't have done it without Tartle.~
@875  = ~I acted alone.~
@876  = ~You'll die never knowing.~
@877  = ~Very interesting. And what do you plan to do with your freedom once you win it?~ [OH100566]
@878  = ~Trying to stall me won't save you, scum.~
@879  = ~I will return to a life of adventure.~
@880  = ~Settle down and build a family.~
@881  = ~Find somewhere to ply my trade and build a career.~
@882  = ~I'll dance on your grave for a start.~
@883  = ~Did you enjoy any of your matches here?~ [OH100567]
@884  = ~Enough stalling, Dennaton. It's over.~
@885  = ~I enjoyed pitting myself against some of your tougher acts, like the liches or those little Bhaalspawns.~
@886  = ~No sane <PRO_MANWOMAN> enjoys fighting for survival. Let's see how you like it.~
@887  = ~I expect I'll enjoy this last one.~
@888  = ~I see. Very helpful. Now, what else would I like to know...?~ [OH100568]
@889  = ~I'm not stalling. You fascinate me, truly.~ [OH100569]
@890  = ~FINALLY! It took you long enough!~ [OH100570]
@891  = ~FINALLY! It took you long enough! You were right, <CHARNAME>, I was stalling you.~ [OH100571]
@892  = ~Did you get the tarrasque, planetar? Is it here?~ [OH100572]
@893  = ~We can handle our differences later, Winged. There's a much more immediate problem to deal with.~ [OH100574]
@894  = ~We need to be away from here. Your Planar Hunters failed. Our arena's in disarray!~ [OH94276]
@895  = ~You want my head on the floor beside the Winged's? We have plans. If I'm dead, how can I help you eliminate Aznar—~ [OH94278]
@896  = ~But—~ [OH94280]
@897  = ~Wait—~ [OH94282]
@898  = ~He was right, Tartle! I don't have all day!~ [OH90527]
@899  = ~Silence, fool!~ [OH90529]
@900  = ~As Tartle said, I am Dennaton. I own the arena you are now a part of—a very special arena. This is no pit filled with poorly trained slaves stabbing each other for the amusement of the lowborn.~ [OH90531]
@901  = ~No, this arena, MY arena, is unique. There is nothing like it in all of Faerûn.~ [OH90532]
@902  = ~Each of you has been chosen because each of you is a legend. You are among the greatest warriors, assassins, and archmages the world has ever known.~ [OH90533]
@903  = ~Your fame will attract those elements of Thayan society that truly matter to my arena. The entertainment you provide will let me turn THEIR wealth into MY wealth.~ [OH90534]
@904  = ~Well, if you absolutely refuse to fight, I'll have little choice but to kill you. But I'm sure you want this arena to succeed as much as I do. So I'll focus on the positive rather than the negative.~ [OH90539]
@905  = ~Anything you want you will receive. Any culinary treat you crave, any entertainment, no matter how obscure or depraved. Gold, silver, gems... Anything from the four corners of Faerûn I can bring here for you... provided you hold up your end of the bargain.~ [OH90541]
@906  = ~For most fights, you'll be pitted against useless fodder. A few ogres, perhaps, or a group of Cormyrian criminals I "rescued" from the gallows.~ [OH90543]
@907  = ~You'll easily win, but your job is to put on a show. Suck the audience in. Make your opponents' deaths as entertaining as possible! Play with them. Disembowel them in a new and inventive way that displays your expert swordplay and really shows your creativity. Have fun with it! If you enjoy the slaughter, the audience will too!~ [OH90544]
@908  = ~Now allow me to introduce you to each other.~ [OH90545]
@909  = ~First, hailing from the Ten Towns, we have the mighty warrior Voghiln "the Vast"!~ [OH90546]
@910  = ~Excellent! And over here, we have a man of the gods and FOR the people! A man for whom battle and honor are not just words, but a way of life. Yes, it's Timmoth "The Champion" Goodtree!~ [OH90550]
@911  = ~THAT'S the spirit, Timmoth. Play that "destroy the heathens" angle up a bit! The crowds will suck it in! Next up is a man of the cloth. A man whose love of Lathander burns bright as the emerging dawn, yet one who yearns to see the wretched cast into the darkness of the Abyss. I give you Brother Ellraish of the Sun Soul!~ [OH90552]
@912  = ~We could all benefit from such—well, let's call it wisdom.~ [OH90554]
@913  = ~Rrrright.~ [OH90556]
@914  = ~Next, we have a woman eager to be judge, jury... and EXECUTIONER! Equally happy protecting the weak and PUNISHING THE GUILTY! A woman whose name is so great, she needs no nickname. It's Mercy Whitedove!~ [OH90557]
@915  = ~Think of yourselves as my guests, my dear, and of the arena as... an inn. An inn for people who fight and kill others for money and entertainment.~ [OH90559]
@916  = ~Next is a wizard of deceptive power. His aging body may seem past its prime, but his mind is sharp as any blade. I give you Dulf "The Ancient Threat" Ebonbeard!~ [OH90560]
@917  = ~Right, with that cleared up, we can turn to the show itself. As a great bard once said, "All the world's a stage, and all of us merely players! Each of us in our time will play many parts!"~ [OH90572]
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pits */
@918  = ~So now we decide which part each of you shall play. Our main star will be <CHARNAME>, who is already renowned for defeating Sarevok at Baldur's Gate.~ [OH90573]
@919  = ~Oh, by the Nine Hells, why do you interrupt me?! Have I ever not paid before? You'll get your money. Now—~ [OH94237]
@920  = ~I can't get it right now! There's a match about to start. Immediately afterwards, I'll—~ [OH94239]
@921  = ~Of course, you—~ [OH94241]
@922  = ~She calls us demons and devils! Let this impudent performer face the true demons and devils and fight for survival!~ [OH103097]
@923  = ~The time has come to shed this appalling disguise. I am Dormamus no more! Now come, <CHARNAME>, and let us win our freedom!~ [OH100610]
@924  = ~Is it really you?~
@925  = ~You should have stayed out of this, djinni. Guilty consciences are unhealthy.~
@926  = ~No. I'm keeping this one for myself.~
@927  = ~Captain said you can pass. Go on, he's waiting for you.~
@928  = ~You must be one of the new Nosers. Come on in. They'll be expecting you upstairs.~
@929  = ~You again. I see they're keeping you busy up there. Come on in.~
@930  = ~Only Master Dennaton, the Planar Hunters, and their servants are allowed through here. Go back the way you came.~
@931  = ~But one would think the guards would have some way of opening any door here. What would they do if the slaves barricaded themselves in a room?~ [OH92950]
@932  = ~I remember my adventuring days. Vaguely.~ [OH92951]
@933  = ~And you are...? Uh... What—what is this place? Are—are you my apprentice?~ [OH95643]
@934  = ~I am not. Farewell, old man.~
@935  = ~You were saying, Geshtemachin—that is your name, correct?—you were saying... well, what WERE you saying?~ [OH95642]
@936  = ~Here, have this drink. It should help you focus.~
@937  = ~Hmm... I—I'll have to reflect on that.~ [OH95647]
@938  = ~Oh! H-hello. Have you been standing there long? Gazmithin and I were... well, we were having an edifying discussion about the, uh... well, something.~ [OH95649]
@939  = ~So, young... one. Uh—uh, you—you wanted to speak to me about... something? Please speak loudly and clearly. Goozlemin is a bit hard of hearing, you see.~ [OH95651]
@940  = ~How did you end up here, Master Ebonbeard?~
@941  = ~What do you make of this place?~
@942  = ~Would you join my team for the next fight in the arena?~
@943  = ~I'll come back later.~
@944  = ~So, uh—Ghoulravin. Yeah, about the beet root's empyreumeutic, uh—e-empyreumatic, uh, salts. Those—those salts...~ [OH95656]
@945  = ~Well, it—it's good to see you again, uh, Grubash Nettlehammer! Haha! Ha... huh. That's just old man humor. I remember you just fine, <CHARNAME>. What can I do for you?~ [OH95660]
@946  = ~I have the components you requested for the scroll.~
@947  = ~I have this shard from the mirror in Bannor's room. Will it suffice as a scroll component?~
@948  = ~How's the scroll coming?~
@949  = ~I could use a wizard with your experience in the arena.~
@950  = ~I changed my mind. I'll help you acquire the scroll components.~
@951  = ~Here are the 12,000 gold pieces you wanted for the scroll.~
@952  = ~About that scroll—I can give you 8,000 gold pieces for it.~
@953  = ~How did you come to be here, Lord Ebonbeard?~
@954  = ~Nothing for now. Just checking to see how you were.~
@955  = ~Well, don't—don't worry, I—I still know who you are, <CHARNAME>. Now, what can I do for you?~ [OH95671]
@956  = ~I have the material components you need for the scroll.~
@957  = ~I have this shard from the mirror in Bannor's room. Will it do as a scroll component?~
@958  = ~How is the scroll coming along?~
@959  = ~I could use a wizard's help in the arena.~
@960  = ~I changed my mind. I'll get the components you need for that scroll.~
@961  = ~About that scroll. I can only give you 8,000 gold pieces for it.~
@962  = ~For now? Nothing. That may change soon.~
@963  = ~Well, when it does, be sure to let me know.~ [OH95680]
@964  = ~Ah, good, y-you're here. Come, my apprentice, we... we've got much work to do.~ [OH95681]
@965  = ~Before we do that, have a drink. To your health!~
@966  = ~I'm afraid I can't help you right now. Farewell.~
@967  = ~No! You—you don't understand! The diacritics on the old Netherese scrolls ARE critical to proper recitation—~ [OH95684]
@968  = ~With pleasure, Gatchounkemin. Uh, here's to your health, my—my young friend.~ [OH95692]
@969  = ~Ah! Much better. Uh, thank you, <CHARNAME>. I—I—I—I take it you want to speak with me?~ [OH95693]
@970  = ~I have the material components you need to make the scroll.~
@971  = ~I have this shard from the mirror in Bannor's room; will it suffice as a component for the scroll?~
@972  = ~How's work on the scroll progressing?~
@973  = ~Not right now.~
@974  = ~And to you, my—my young friend...~ [OH95702]
@975  = ~Oh, my, that, uh... that IS tasty! Mmm! My head feels, uh... feels light all of a sudden.~ [OH95703]
@976  = ~Gezzthemin, w-what is in that drink? Bring me a barrel! I feel twenty years younger—in mind, if not body.~ [OH95704]
@977  = ~Well, I hope there's more where it came from. These tonics never last very long, unfortunately.~ [OH95706]
@978  = ~So, you had a question. I—I'm all yours. For the time being, at least.~ [OH95707]
@979  = ~How did a master magician like yourself end up here?~
@980  = ~Tell me, what do you make of this place?~
@981  = ~I've no use for you now. Perhaps we'll talk more later.~
@982  = ~I can't really recall... The last thing I remember, I was in the Cloven Mountains, riding towards Lachom. The library there houses a collection of scrolls I wished to study.~ [OH95712]
@983  = ~Speaking of scrolls, I have the material components you asked for.~
@984  = ~On a related subject, I have this shard from the mirror in Bannor's room. Will it suffice as a scroll component?~
@985  = ~As you mention scrolls, how is ours coming along?~
@986  = ~I could use a wizard of your experience in the arena.~
@987  = ~What do you make of this place, Master Ebonbeard?~
@988  = ~You were doubtless attacked and captured by the Winged and her crew. Nearly all of us were.~
@989  = ~I haven't seen much of it. Or maybe I have and just don't remember. It reminds me of some of the wizardry schools built beneath the forest floor of Cormanthor. They did that to protect the ancient trees in the event of an "incident" in one of the schools.~ [OH95719]
@990  = ~The PEOPLE who brought and keep us here are much more distinct. I remember Dennaton's speech. And I've a very clear picture of the planetar they call the Winged, as well as the large metal golem that follows her.~ [OH95720]
@991  = ~I know who that golem is, or rather was.~ [OH95721]
@992  = ~Bannor was a terrifically talented wizard.~ [OH95723]
@993  = ~Well, just so. A terrifically talented wizard.~ [OH95724]
@994  = ~Nobody knows exactly how he ended up in the adamantine golem's form. I theorize he was experimenting with spirit transference, a school of magic not yet fully developed.~ [OH95725]
@995  = ~I doubt anyone even knows where that body is now. But the original vessel is unimportant. His mind could be transferred to any being, and that being's spirit would replace his in the golem. It could be done by a supremely skilled wizard.~ [OH95727]
@996  = ~I don't know if anyone ever tried to return his mind to his body. But the original vessel is unimportant. His mind could be transferred to any being, and that being's spirit would replace his in the golem. It could be done, by a supremely skilled wizard. I might be able to manage it...~ [OH95729]
@997  = ~Perhaps...~ [OH95730]
@998  = ~How would you go about it?~
@999  = ~Really? You could do that?~
@1000 = ~Sounds like you may be losing touch with reality again. Do you need another drink?~
@1001 = ~The spell required is long and complicated. I'd need to inscribe it on a scroll beforehand. All I'd need are a few material components. What do you say? Would you like to help?~ [OH95734]
@1002 = ~Of course.~
@1003 = ~I'd like to, but I won't.~
@1004 = ~You're beyond my help, ancient one.~
@1005 = ~Well, you sound doubtful. Well, you've good reason to be, I suppose.~ [OH95738]
@1006 = ~Well, it wouldn't hurt, but I—I believe I'm all right for now.~ [OH95739]
@1007 = ~Wonderful. Get me a wyrm tooth, a carrion crawler egg, and parchment made from ettin skin. Also, I'll need something belonging to Bannor. Anything, so long as it's unique to him. Come back when you have everything and I'll get right on it. What a wonderful, exciting project. It's almost rejuvenating!~ [OH95740]
@1008 = ~Well, that's a shame. Gezzthemin, how about you? Would you like to help?~ [OH95741]
@1009 = ~Well, that's a shame! Well... if you change your mind, I'll—I'll be around.~ [OH95743]
@1010 = ~Me? You want me? An old wizard like me? You're not afraid I'll crumple to the ground in the middle of it?~ [OH95744]
@1011 = ~Your experience will pay off. I'll give you 1,500 gold pieces to join me.~
@1012 = ~1,500 gold pieces seems to be the going rate for arena assistance. I don't have that much yet. When I do, I'll be in touch.~
@1013 = ~You may be right. Never mind.~
@1014 = ~Well, it's good someone values the contribution of their elders. Of course I will join you. Same conditions as before.~ [OH95748]
@1015 = ~Here are 1,500 gold pieces.~
@1016 = ~I don't have the 1,500 gold pieces. Perhaps another time.~
@1017 = ~Actually, I've changed my mind.~
@1018 = ~Well, it's good to feel wanted despite one's advanced age. Uh—let's go kick some arses. We'll boot them all the way to Icewind Dale!~ [OH95752]
@1019 = ~Well, I've never been good with money myself. Like you say, maybe another time.~ [OH95753]
@1020 = ~Well, I understand. The gods know mine changes often enough! Maybe another time, then.~ [OH95754]
@1021 = ~Wonderful, let—let me see. Yes, everything I need is there.~ [OH95755]
@1022 = ~With that and the piece of Bannor's broken mirror, I have all I need to begin. I'll let you know when it's done.~ [OH95756]
@1023 = ~Almost. Uh, have you an item belonging to Bannor?~ [OH95757]
@1024 = ~I have this shard from the mirror in Bannor's room. Will it suffice?~
@1025 = ~I haven't found anything yet. I'll return when I do.~
@1026 = ~Well, that should work.~ [OH95760]
@1027 = ~I've given this project some thought. I initially took it on as an activity to busy my mind, but there may be more use to it. An ally's mind could be transferred to the golem, bringing its might to our side.~ [OH95761]
@1028 = ~But, given the complex magic involved, only one who is intimate with the Weave—a wizard or a sorcerer—will be able to make the transfer.~ [OH95762]
@1029 = ~Well, you can see just how dangerous this scroll could be. Scribing is an immense commitment. I must be certain you are fully committed as well. To prove this, I'll need some substantial coin. 12,000 gold pieces.~ [OH95763]
@1030 = ~12,000 gold pieces! Drink some more of your salve, old man. Make it 8,000.~
@1031 = ~That's a lot of gold. Fortunately, I have a lot of gold. Here it is.~
@1032 = ~That's a lot of gold. I just don't have that much right now.~
@1033 = ~Let me think on this.~
@1034 = ~12,000 gold pieces? I don't need the scroll that badly.~
@1035 = ~8,000 gold pieces will suffice.~ [OH95769]
@1036 = ~I have everything I need to begin. I'll let you know when I am finished.~ [OH95770]
@1037 = ~Do you have the other components I requested?~ [OH95771]
@1038 = ~Not yet. I'll be back when I do.~
@1039 = ~Here they are.~
@1040 = ~Well, excellent! Now I am confident of your commitment.~ [OH95774]
@1041 = ~I'll begin work on the scroll nonetheless. But you'll not get it till I get the gold.~ [OH95775]
@1042 = ~When you change your mind, let me know.~ [OH95776]
@1043 = ~Let me know when you make your decision.~ [OH95777]
@1044 = ~Well, this magic takes time. I'll come to you when the scroll is ready.~ [OH95778]
@1045 = ~Wait? Well, who are we waiting on? A-a-are YOU the one we're waiting on?~ [OH92880]
@1046 = ~Re-rebel? Why? What—? W-who are you?~ [OH92887]
@1047 = ~Bravo! Who's Tartle?~ [OH92895]
@1048 = ~I think the more important question is... wait, what were we talking about?~
@1049 = ~Woohoo! Ha... ha... What are... ha... what are we cheering about again? ~ [OH92923]
@1050 = ~Huh? Well, they say you're—you're going to do something dangerous. Whatever that is, good luck!~ [OH92985]
@1051 = ~I have a feeling this was for you. It has your name on it, in any case. Good tidings, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>!~
@1052 = ~Thanks for all you've done, <CHARNAME>. Take this. My father gave it to me when I became a chef. Maybe it'll prove useful against Dennaton. ~
@1053 = ~Well done, whoever you are! Who are you again...?~ [OH100625]
@1054 = ~Huh? What? W-where am I? Who are you? Who am I?~ [OH90561]
@1055 = ~You have done well, besting Dennaton, but that's no reason to stop the entertainment. I, Elgiad, have scoured the planes far and wide. I offer challenges far greater than Dennaton ever did, rare and ferocious creatures and gladiators of unmatched martial and arcane prowess. Join me!~ [OH100784]
@1056 = ~Very well, I am ready for another match.~
@1057 = ~Not right now. I still need time to prepare.~
@1058 = ~Excellent! Step this way! The competition awaits!~ [OH100785]
@1059 = ~Come back when you're ready. I cannot wait to see you face my special challenges!~ [OH100786]
@1060 = ~For your first challenge, I give you some familiar faces. You might once have counted these six as allies, but you must have known they'd as soon slit your throat as save your hide! Now's their chance! To arms!~ [OH100789]
@1061 = ~You may have expected those last miscreants to turn on you for a couple of coppers, but you would doubtless have trusted these next six to your dying breath. Surprise! Friend is turned to foe! Combatants, to arms!~ [OH100790]
@1062 = ~She's a bloodsucking lady of the night with a penchant for graveyards. He's an insane once-elven wizard with a healthy lust for revenge. What do these siblings have in common other than a creepy obsession with you? NOTHING! You've fought them both before. Now face them again, but this time TOGETHER! Combatants! To arms!~ [OH100791]
@1063 = ~You have bested the two exiles and their minions! Well played, but I have someone even tougher than they, one strong enough to challenge even the gods themselves. This lady took delusion to a whole new level. I'm sure you've already guessed who she is, so let's bring her out and get this party started!~ [OH100792]
@1064 = ~Amazing! Astounding! A—eh, I'll leave the alliteration to Baeloth. The previous challenger thought herself a god—the next one actually is! Or, rather, was. That's right, here's your chance to take on the Lord of Murder himself: Bhaal! To arms!~ [OH100793]
@1065 = ~Well done! You have faced all manner of creature—heroic mortals, reprehensible villains, fiends, even a god—and defeated them all. It's tempting to simply declare you victorious, but there's still one challenger so vile, so reprehensible, and so feared that ALL who encounter him flee in screaming irritation!~ [OH100794]
@1066 = ~I will not lie, he causes even me to recoil in horror. But to be the best, you must beat the worst. And so I give you... your final challenge!~ [OH100795]
@1067 = ~Welcome back, friend. Are you ready to test your skill in the arena against MY menagerie?~ [OH100787]
@1068 = ~WHAT?! I mean—what can I do for you, my stray sheep?~ [OH92534]
@1069 = ~What do you want? Er, I mean, greetings of the Vigilant One, Lathander, to you, blessed, uh, child. In what way might this humble monk be of service to you?~ [OH92484]
@1070 = ~Hello. Who are you?~
@1071 = ~Isn't Helm called "The Vigilant One?"~
@1072 = ~Something funny's going on here. Are you sure you are a monk?~
@1073 = ~I must be going.~
@1074 = ~I'd sooner take financial advice from a beggar than a blessing from you.~
@1075 = ~May Lathander watch over you. And remember, I'm always open to donations to, ah, further his work.~ [OH92491]
@1076 = ~I'll slice you from belly to—ah, I mean, Lathander, god of the dead, will, uh, judge your words when you pass from this world and stand before him.~ [OH92492]
@1077 = ~Understanding comes only with time and many donations to the church of Lathander, the god of knowledge, understanding, and, ah... bountiful donations.~ [OH92494]
@1078 = ~Uh... okay... can I ask you something else?~
@1079 = ~Never mind, I must be going.~
@1080 = ~You are living proof that ignorance truly is bliss.~
@1081 = ~Why? What've you heard? That is, I'm a monk of Lathander, of course. I am Brother Ellraish, a monk of the Sun Soul and follower of Lathander, god of nature and flowing rivers! All donations accepted.~ [OH92500]
@1082 = ~Good to meet you, Ellraish. May I ask you something else?~
@1083 = ~What are the donations for?~
@1084 = ~I'm sure they are. I'll be going now.~
@1085 = ~Donations? Sounds like a scam to me. ~
@1086 = ~For the... ah... starving... children! Yes. The starving children. Yes! All donations accepted for the poor starving orphans of, er, Lantan. Think of all those destitute boys and girls shivering in the icy snow.~ [OH92508]
@1087 = ~Please, take these 10 gold pieces. It's not much, I know, but—~
@1088 = ~Doesn't Lantan have a temperate climate? It doesn't snow there.~
@1089 = ~More likely the donations go to Brother Ellraish. What a sham!~
@1090 = ~10 gold? That's IT? I mean... please consider that the winter has been especially harsh this year. Surely you could spare some more.~ [OH92513]
@1091 = ~Very well. Here is 100 gold.~
@1092 = ~Wait, Lantan has a temperate climate, does it not? It doesn't snow there.~
@1093 = ~If my donation isn't enough for you, I'll just be moving on.~
@1094 = ~Perhaps I could, but not for this sham of a charity.~
@1095 = ~Aha! Now I can buy that new—turkey. For the starving widows. Ahhh... Lathander's blessing on you. I must pray now!~ [OH92517]
@1096 = ~Oh no! I assure you—it is quite cold there. Nothing but tundra yetis and floating chunks of ice.~ [OH92518]
@1097 = ~I'd like to ask you something else.~
@1098 = ~I'm going to check this out. If it's true, I'll return.~
@1099 = ~You're as dumb as a tundra yeti if you think I'm buying that. ~
@1100 = ~When the mouse enters his burrow, does he not find the seeds he has stored away for the winter? And does not the winter follow the fall? Therein lies the answer to your question.~ [OH92522]
@1101 = ~That doesn't make any sense.~
@1102 = ~I'm going to leave now and give your words the consideration they merit.~
@1103 = ~I don't know about mice and seeds, but you're nuts.~
@1104 = ~Of course! Why else would I have this shaved head?~ [OH92525]
@1105 = ~But... your head isn't shaved.~
@1106 = ~Oh, forget this.~
@1107 = ~A delusional monk. Just when I thought this place couldn't get any weirder.~
@1108 = ~It's a wig. I'm far too humble to display my deep devotion and piety to my fellow performers, so I wear a wig.~ [OH92528]
@1109 = ~Discussing it clearly makes you uncomfortable. May I ask you something else?~
@1110 = ~It doesn't look like a wig. ~
@1111 = ~Your humility is something else. I must be going.~
@1112 = ~You may have something atop your head, but there's little inside of it.~
@1113 = ~Things are not always as they seem! Does an apple tree bear acorns? Does the bear resemble the walnut in the thicket when spring melts the winter snows? So it is with my wig.~ [OH92531]
@1114 = ~That... doesn't make any sense.~
@1115 = ~I must take some time to contemplate this wisdom. Excuse me.~
@1116 = ~That is quite possibly the most nonsensical statement that has ever reached my ears.~
@1117 = ~Who are you, again?~
@1118 = ~Can I ask you some questions?~
@1119 = ~Brother Ellraish, I need some help dealing with a... delicate situation.~
@1120 = ~Brother, I'm in need of assistance. Would you help me in my next match?~
@1121 = ~I have the powdered quartz and rat droppings for the poison.~
@1122 = ~I've returned with the runestone you requested.~
@1123 = ~Nothing, never mind.~
@1124 = ~Lathander is "the Curious God"! Ask away.~ [OH92541]
@1125 = ~Lathander's "the Curious God"? Are you sure about that?~
@1126 = ~Would you mind telling me a little more about yourself?~
@1127 = ~Tell me how you came to be here, Brother Ellraish.~
@1128 = ~Consider this: You have come to me with questions, and I have spoken to you of Lathander, which has prompted more questions.~ [OH92546]
@1129 = ~Yes, even as the egg reveals its secret in the summertime and blooms into a wondrous... butterfly, Lathander incites wonder and curiosities in his followers! Even as the honeybee causes the oxen to migrate west in times of drought, so Lathander reveals the deepest secrets and rewards his followers.~ [OH92547]
@1130 = ~Have you ever actually listened to what's coming out of your mouth?~
@1131 = ~I am a monk of the Sun Soul. I've taken vows of poverty, shaved my head, and now proclaim the wonders of Lathander, god of suffering! I also accept donations.~ [OH92550]
@1132 = ~But... your head isn't shaved. You have hair.~
@1133 = ~Lathander's the god of suffering? I thought that was Ilmater. ~
@1134 = ~Vows of poverty don't justify a tongue of stupidity.~
@1135 = ~Yes. Quite sure. God of suffering. ~ [OH92554]
@1136 = ~If you say so. I'd like to ask you something else.~
@1137 = ~I'll take your word for it. Well, no, I won't, but I will be leaving.~
@1138 = ~Of course! Anything for a donation. Uh, and to help a soul in need. What's the problem?~ [OH92557]
@1139 = ~I need a poison.~
@1140 = ~I need to unlock the door to the Hunters' Lounge.~
@1141 = ~Poison? What would a monk such as myself know about poison?~ [OH92560]
@1142 = ~I have 1,000 gold to spend on some poison. Are you sure you know nothing of poisons?~
@1143 = ~Surely a learned man like you knows something of poisons.~
@1144 = ~Bah! You are worthless. ~
@1145 = ~WAIT! I have just had a vision from Lathander. I have been shown how to create a poison in return for your donation of 1,000 gold coins. She has shown me: I need some powdered quartz and rat droppings.~ [OH92564]
@1146 = ~Very well, here is the 1,000 gold.~
@1147 = ~I'll return when I have the donation.~
@1148 = ~Powdered quartz and rat droppings? What nonsense. ~
@1149 = ~Well... I may know something of them. Unfortunately, I am forbidden by my god to create them unless a donation of... say... 1,000 gold is made to the cause of Lathander. I'll also need some powdered quartz and rat droppings to complete the mixture. ~ [OH92568]
@1150 = ~Here's your poison. Pleasure doing business—I mean, Lathander bless you.~ [OH92573]
@1151 = ~I was investigating that vault near the merchant stalls. I heard there are powerful magical items in there... all for the Sun Soul brotherhood, of course! I wouldn't dream of breaking into it and taking everything for myself.~ [OH92574]
@1152 = ~While engaged in a completely legal and legitimate investigation of a certain highly sought-after holy relic, I was captured by that unholy Winged and her bounty hunters.~ [OH92575]
@1153 = ~Right. I would like to ask you something else.~
@1154 = ~You are the worst liar I have ever met.~
@1155 = ~Of course I would! Lathander is the god of battle and warriors, after all!~ [OH92580]
@1156 = ~A VISION! I have had a vision from above! Lathander has revealed to me the location of a key to the Hunters' Lounge. He is the god of keys and opening doors, you know. Before I give it to you, though, Lathander has a task for you.~ [OH92582]
@1157 = ~There is a certain runestone held by the illithid merchant. Lathander demands you bring me the stone before I can give you the key.~ [OH92584]
@1158 = ~Lathander be praised! Here is your key. ~ [OH92585]
@1159 = ~The Pits of Despair seem darkest to those who will not see.~ [OH90553]
@1160 = ~A lion alone can have no pride.~ [OH90555]
@1161 = ~I'll make a necklace of their ears!~ [OH92948]
@1162 = ~Animals are as likely to turn on us as the guards.~ [OH92949]
@1163 = ~What're you lookin' at? You tired o' havin' eyes in their sockets? Because they won't be there long if you don't look elsewhere!~ [OH92379]
@1164 = ~Back off, orc. He's on the List. You can kill him when I'm finished!~ [OH90579]
@1165 = ~Hold, everyone. We'll gain nothing by fighting each other!~
@1166 = ~You pathetic nitwits! Don't you get that we're all slaves? You do this fool's bidding, fighting each other!~
@1167 = ~Oh, good. A fight! Finally, some entertainment.~
@1168 = ~Wrong. I'll gain the satisfaction of gutting a pompous ape.~ [OH90583]
@1169 = ~Why would you do something like that?~
@1170 = ~I'm guessing you aren't Dennaton's hospitality coordinator.~
@1171 = ~Never mind. I was just leaving.~
@1172 = ~If you want to reach my eyes, you are going to need a ladder.~
@1173 = ~Yeah, that's right. Walk away. It's the smart thing to do.~ [OH92384]
@1174 = ~THAT'S IT! You just made the List!~ [OH92385]
@1175 = ~Because I'm good at it.~ [OH92386]
@1176 = ~Why don't you open your mouth and tell me what you want before I drastically change your outlook on the world? You got five seconds.~ [OH92387]
@1177 = ~WHOA! Easy! I just want to know who you are.~
@1178 = ~I've a question for you.~
@1179 = ~Five seconds? Sounds like you're SHORT on time.~
@1180 = ~Feldrak Feldrak'i. "The Fiend," Dennaton calls me. You heard of the Mirabar massacre? That was mine. Murders of Malford? That was mine too. ~ [OH92391]
@1181 = ~The Drowning of the Deepwash, the Killing of Kingsdale, the Hanging of Hargrove, the Beating of Belverston, and the Burning of Browswaithe. All mine. All on the List.~ [OH92392]
@1182 = ~That's... informative. May I ask you something else?~
@1183 = ~What about the Chokings on the Chionthar? Was that yours too?~
@1184 = ~The List? What's that?~
@1185 = ~Okay. I'm just going to be leaving now.~
@1186 = ~You did all those, eh? Well, at least they were only LITTLE problems.~
@1187 = ~Nah, that was some gnome gang hopped up on turnip juice. Crazy buggers. Not right in the head. ~ [OH92396]
@1188 = ~There's something else I'd like to know.~
@1189 = ~Wait, aren't you a gnome?~
@1190 = ~Never heard of the List, huh? Not surprised. Most who know about the List end up on the List, and those on the List don't live long enough to talk about the List. That's what the List is for. Helps me remember who's getting "x-ed" next.~ [OH92399]
@1191 = ~"X-ed"? what does that mean?~
@1192 = ~Why do most who know about the List end up on the List?~
@1193 = ~Can I ask you something else?~
@1194 = ~I'm guessing you use a list because your memory is as short as you are.~
@1195 = ~"X-ed." Offed, snuffed, permanently silenced, sleeping eternally, done in, resting in pieces, exterminated. It's what I do to those who get too curious. Got any other questions?~ [OH92404]
@1196 = ~Actually, I do.~
@1197 = ~No, I'll just be going now.~
@1198 = ~I do. For your benefit, I'll try to keep things SHORT.~
@1199 = ~Most people who know about the List hear about it from me—when I tell them they're on the List. Still feeling curious?~ [OH92406]
@1200 = ~Actually, yes. I have another question for you.~
@1201 = ~No, I'll be going now. Rapidly.~
@1202 = ~No need to be SHORT with me. I was just asking.~
@1203 = ~Hospitality coordinator? You think that's funny? You watch your step. You're real close to making the List.~ [OH92409]
@1204 = ~Whoa, easy! I just wanted to know who you are.~
@1205 = ~You sure do have a SHORT fuse!~
@1206 = ~You got a question for me? You got five seconds. Talk fast. ~ [OH92412]
@1207 = ~Who are you again?~
@1208 = ~Would you tell me a little about yourself?~
@1209 = ~Would you like to help me in my next fight?~
@1210 = ~I have the ingredients you need.~
@1211 = ~I could use your help with something.~
@1212 = ~Why d'you wanna know?~ [OH92419]
@1213 = ~I heard you were a mercenary before you were brought here.~
@1214 = ~Talk about a SHORT temper!~
@1215 = ~I guess you could say that. I'll put it like this: When somebody's got a problem with somebody else, I get a message, some money changes hands, and the problem goes away.~ [OH92422]
@1216 = ~Sometimes people don't even realize they are a problem. They end up on the List, the problem gets dealt with, and I get whatever happens to be in the problem's purse at the time.~ [OH92423]
@1217 = ~What's this List you spoke of?~
@1218 = ~So you do hired killings.~
@1219 = ~I'll be going now.~
@1220 = ~Well, at least your problems are SMALL ones.~
@1221 = ~Sometimes I'm hired. Sometimes I do freelance work on my own. You know, walk into a bar and find out the biggest guy in there happens to be in my seat. Nothing I can do but put him on the List.~ [OH92426]
@1222 = ~So, you just kill for the fun of it?~
@1223 = ~I imagine everyone in the bar would be bigger than you.~
@1224 = ~I kill for a lot of reasons. Got any more questions?~ [OH92431]
@1225 = ~Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.~
@1226 = ~No, I'm SHORT on time and must be going.~
@1227 = ~So I walked into this dump of a tavern in Luskan. Just finished three big jobs and had some gold to drink through. First thing I see is a great big guy at the bar.~ [OH92433]
@1228 = ~He looked pudgy—slow, you know? Should've looked twice. Soon as I explained his newly acquired "on the List" status, he throws off his cloak and grabs me. In the tavern light, I saw him as clear as day! He was made of metal.~ [OH92434]
@1229 = ~I must've stabbed him a hundred times! He just smashed me in the face a dozen or so times until I blacked out. I woke up here. Thanks for remindin' me—I need to put that guy on the top of the List.~ [OH92435]
@1230 = ~I've another question for you, if you don't mind.~
@1231 = ~Sounds like a SHORT fight.~
@1232 = ~Sure. I'm in a killing mood. I'll meet you in the arena when it's time.~ [OH92438]
@1233 = ~What am I, your mother?~ [OH92439]
@1234 = ~I was just wondering if you knew where I could find some poison.~
@1235 = ~Actually, there is a slim chance—no, I don't think so.~
@1236 = ~Funny stuff. You know what I think is funny? X-ing people.~ [OH94908]
@1237 = ~"X-ing" people? what does that mean?~
@1238 = ~That is funny. It'd probably be even funnier if I knew what in the Nine Hells you were talking about.~
@1239 = ~Maybe I do and maybe I don't. Sometimes I need assistance jogging my memory—1,200 pieces of assistance to be exact.~ [OH92442]
@1240 = ~1,200 gold? I can manage that. Here.~
@1241 = ~I don't seem to have enough gold. I must be going.~
@1242 = ~Forget it. I was just leaving.~
@1243 = ~All right. I got most of what I need. Get me some wine vinegar and some rose petals, and we're set. Ah, don't look at me like that. You want the poison, you find 'em.~ [OH92446]
@1244 = ~Heh. Ya found 'em. Didn't expect that. But fair's fair. I have a mixture almost ready to go. Let me just add these ingredients... and there we go. ~ [OH92447]
@1245 = ~No waiting. This is killing time. Let's go!~ [OH92876]
@1246 = ~Don't listen to them! I've got a fever, and the only cure is bloodshed!~ [OH92886]
@1247 = ~I'll flay the flesh from his bones and suck out the marrow!~ [OH92899]
@1248 = ~Tartle, that little pig! I'll flay his flesh from his bones and suck out the marrow!~ [OH92914]
@1249 = ~Enough words! Let's kill somethin' already!~ [OH92926]
@1250 = ~Save Dennaton's eyeballs for me.~ [OH92984]
@1251 = ~Nice job—TOO nice. The Winged was on the List, and you killed her. Normally, that'd get you on the List. I'll make an exception this one time.~ [OH100622]
@1252 = ~Stranglin' your enemy with their own entrails. A classic.~ [OH90496]
@1253 = ~You're joking. I'm the greatest warrior here—the glory should be mine.~ [OH90574]
@1254 = ~Half the warrior you are? What, you ate a fighter who wasn't a drunken fatass?~ [OH90576]
@1255 = ~You, come over here. Let me have a look at you.~
@1256 = ~I recognize you. You're not a Noser; you're a performer. Your trick worked on my boy downstairs, but you don't have me fooled.~
@1257 = ~You, stop right there. You're not supposed to be up here.~
@1258 = ~Master Dennaton asked me to get something from the Winged's room.~
@1259 = ~Sorry, I'm lost. I'll just go back the way I came.~
@1260 = ~I'm the new Noser, but I haven't received my uniform yet.~
@1261 = ~Sure he did. And I'm Duke Belt's long lost son.~
@1262 = ~Nobody gets lost up here. Nobody who isn't trespassing, anyway.~
@1263 = ~Dennaton would have told me if a new staff member were coming.~
@1264 = ~You and I both know you're not supposed to be here. Dennaton wouldn't be happy about this. Not at all.~
@1265 = ~Maybe he doesn't need to find out. I could let you go on your way—if you make it worth my while.~
@1266 = ~You could buy passage from me for, say, 5,000 gold? Or you could take care of something I've been wanting dealt with. What would you prefer?~
@1267 = ~Take the gold, you greedy swine.~
@1268 = ~I don't have that kind of gold.~
@1269 = ~What would you want taken care of?~
@1270 = ~Welcome to the Hunters' Lounge. Don't call attention to yourself or we'll both be in trouble.~
@1271 = ~Then you've no choice but to do me that little service, do you?~
@1272 = ~And if I refuse?~
@1273 = ~Let's hear it.~
@1274 = ~You won't, not if you like breathing.~
@1275 = ~I said I wanted you to take care of something. It's actually someone. Worst thing about it is he's one of my guards. But he's got loose lips. Can't keep guard business between us guards.~
@1276 = ~I can't fire him. He's one of Dennaton's nephews, which means his casual talk might reach our master's ears. And that wouldn't be good for morale.~
@1277 = ~His name's Branson. He's usually on his bunk when he's off-duty. Cut his throat, pierce his heart, I don't care. Just get it done and I'll turn my head on your comings and goings here and have my boys to do the same.~
@1278 = ~Are you sure you wouldn't rather pay the gold? Once I tell you what I need, there's no turning back—that offer's off the table.~
@1279 = ~Something tells me I'm happier not knowing. Take the gold.~
@1280 = ~I don't have that kind of money.~
@1281 = ~Fine. Tell me what you need.~
@1282 = ~You again? Don't you have things to take care of downstairs? Go back and don't return before it's done.~
@1283 = ~I'm told Branson is nowhere to be found, but nobody's seen his body. If you took care of him, what's your proof?~
@1284 = ~Here's his family ring. I got it off his body.~
@1285 = ~Dennaton has one just like it. It's apparently very important in their family. Good work. But what did you do with the body?~
@1286 = ~It's wyvern dung now.~
@1287 = ~Piled it in with the other arena cadavers.~
@1288 = ~Trade secret.~
@1289 = ~All right. Well then, the Hunters' Lounge is yours to explore. Don't attract attention to yourself or we'll both feed Stirv's beasts.~
@1290 = ~I hear you've taken care of things downstairs. Good <PRO_GIRLBOY>. The Hunters' Lounge is yours to explore. Don't attract attention to yourself or we'll both feed Stirv's beasts.~
@1291 = ~You and I have nothing to talk about. Keep it that way. Stay out of my trouble.~
@1292 = ~You leave me no choice but to kill you, slaves! Dennaton's orders be damned!~
@1293 = ~Your little rebellion has come to naught, slaves! When the Hunters return—or reinforcements arrive—we'll destroy you. Or maybe we'll just let you starve and watch you die slow!~
@1294 = ~Stormed the barracks, did you? It matters not. You're trapped and reinforcements will arrive any minute.~
@1295 = ~Don't touch me! Stay back!~ [OH95876]
@1296 = ~Relax, friend. I mean you no harm.~
@1297 = ~What's wrong?~
@1298 = ~Would you like me to come back later?~
@1299 = ~Okaaay. Sure thing, I'll leave you alone.~
@1300 = ~That would be for the best. I don't want to hurt you.~ [OH95881]
@1301 = ~Is there anything I can do to help you?~
@1302 = ~You won't hurt me, I assure you.~
@1303 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@1304 = ~Sometimes I hurt people without meaning to. They said they'd help. "Come with us; we can help you," they said. Lies, all lies.~ [OH95885]
@1305 = ~They said they'd help me. Lies. There is no one here who can help me. Here or anywhere.~ [OH95886]
@1306 = ~They tricked me. The Winged said she knew someone who could teach me to control the fire, the explosions, all the magic that comes out of me.~ [OH95888]
@1307 = ~I've burned down villages, killed hundreds of innocent people, turned flocks of sheep into rattlesnakes and farmers into chickens.~ [OH95889]
@1308 = ~I've had enough of it. Nobody—~ [OH95890]
@1309 = ~Thank you, Molzahn. I do hope she smiles upon me. Someone's got to, surely.~ [OH95892]
@1310 = ~Why did the Hunters bring you here?~
@1311 = ~I was thinking I'd ask you to join me in the arena.~
@1312 = ~Are you able to prepare scrolls, by any chance?~
@1313 = ~Good luck.~
@1314 = ~Certainly not to help me. I suspect they or Dennaton thought it would be entertaining to have a wild mage in the arena.~ [OH95897]
@1315 = ~I was thinking I'd ask you to join me in my next battle.~
@1316 = ~You're mad, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Why would you want that?~ [OH95900]
@1317 = ~Dennaton wouldn't have brought you here if he thought you posed a real threat.~
@1318 = ~What can I say? I'm a risk-taker.~
@1319 = ~I love the idea that everything could blow up at any time. It's exciting.~
@1320 = ~Well, if that's what you believe, all right, I'll join you for your next fight.~ [OH95904]
@1321 = ~Well, as long as you realize what you're getting into. All right, I'll join you for your next fight in the arena.~ [OH95905]
@1322 = ~I used to think that too. It's less amusing after you've accidentally wiped out an entire bloodline. But, all right, I'll join you in the arena if you truly want me to.~ [OH95906]
@1323 = ~Given the risk you're taking, I don't feel right asking you for the going rate for allies. How about we say 500 gold pieces?~ [OH95907]
@1324 = ~Sounds good to me.~
@1325 = ~It's a good offer, but I don't have that much gold on me.~
@1326 = ~Come to think of it, maybe it's not such a great idea.~
@1327 = ~Great, this is great. I'll try not to disappoint you, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH95911]
@1328 = ~Don't worry about it, then. I'll join you for free this time. You're doing me a favor. I'm just happy someone wants me on their side.~ [OH95912]
@1329 = ~Terrific.~
@1330 = ~On second thought, I think I'd rather go it alone.~
@1331 = ~Hmm... I did join you last time for free. Don't get me wrong, I thought we worked very well together. But I'd like the gold this time. Ask me again when you have enough.~ [OH95915]
@1332 = ~Oh... Okay. That's okay. I understand.~ [OH95916]
@1333 = ~Sometimes...? Why do you ask?~ [OH95917]
@1334 = ~I need a scroll to heal me and my teammates.~
@1335 = ~I need something to increase my and my teammates' strength.~
@1336 = ~I want to swap the minds of two beings.~
@1337 = ~I really want to turn Tartle into a chicken.~
@1338 = ~No reason. Excuse me.~
@1339 = ~I don't know anything about healing. Ask Molzahn; I'm sure she can help you.~ [OH95923]
@1340 = ~All right. What about a scroll to give me and my teammates more strength?~
@1341 = ~I need a scroll to swap the minds of two beings.~
@1342 = ~I need a scroll to turn Tartle into a chicken.~
@1343 = ~I've never cast such a spell, intentionally or otherwise. Sorry.~ [OH95928]
@1344 = ~Could you make a scroll that'd turn Tartle into a chicken?~
@1345 = ~I thought as much, but I had to ask. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@1346 = ~Spirit transference. I've dabbled in it in the past.~ [OH95933]
@1347 = ~I think I could do it. Probably. But, you know, my scrolls are no more reliable than my spells. They generally work as intended... with some unexpected consequences.~ [OH95934]
@1348 = ~If you're game to try, I'll need an item belonging to the being the caster intends to switch bodies with. This is powerful magic. Only skilled spellcasters will be able to use the scroll.~ [OH95935]
@1349 = ~Given that I cannot guarantee its effectiveness, I'll only charge you 4,000 gold pieces. You can pay me when you bring me that item.~ [OH95936]
@1350 = ~I already have such an item. Here.~
@1351 = ~Very well. I'll be back.~
@1352 = ~I need to think about this.~
@1353 = ~Yeah, I'd love to see that. Unfortunately, chicken-shifting for me has only ever been an unintended outcome. I couldn't possibly scribe it onto a scroll.~ [OH95940]
@1354 = ~Could you make a scroll to heal me and my teammates?~
@1355 = ~What about a scroll to give me and my teammates more strength. Could you do that?~
@1356 = ~Keep your distance, <CHARNAME>! I say that to be safe. There's very little chance I'll go off without casting a spell.~ [OH95947]
@1357 = ~I brought you this. It belongs to the one I want to change bodies with.~
@1358 = ~I have the 4,000 gold pieces for the scroll.~
@1359 = ~I'd like you to cast a spell—when you fight next to me in the arena.~
@1360 = ~I've got to ask: Why did the Hunters bring you here?~
@1361 = ~Better safe than sorry. I'll go now.~
@1362 = ~A piece of broken mirror. Interesting. I expected something more personal, but this should do the trick.~ [OH95955]
@1363 = ~Now for the matter of the payment...~ [OH95956]
@1364 = ~Here are your 4,000 gold pieces.~
@1365 = ~I don't have enough gold on me. I will be back.~
@1366 = ~On second thought, I'd rather keep my money than risk it on the skills of someone as erratic as you.~
@1367 = ~Great. I'll get right on it. I'll let you know when it's ready.~ [OH95960]
@1368 = ~I'll be around. Unless I've been brutally slaughtered in the arena.~ [OH95961]
@1369 = ~I am surprised. You seemed pretty keen, and you did bring me that piece of broken mirror. But as you wish. I'll be here if you change your mind.~ [OH95962]
@1370 = ~I've only just started. Give me time.~ [OH95963]
@1371 = ~It's a complex incantation. It takes time. Don't worry, I'll get it done.~ [OH95964]
@1372 = ~Are you sure about that?~ [OH95965]
@1373 = ~Absolutely. We made a fine team last time.~
@1374 = ~I was. Now I'm not.~
@1375 = ~I don't feel right asking you for the going rate, given the risks. How does 500 gold pieces sound to you?~ [OH95969]
@1376 = ~Sounds good. Here you go.~
@1377 = ~It'd sound better if I had that much gold.~
@1378 = ~I'll try not to disappoint you, <CHARNAME>. See you in the arena!~ [OH95973]
@1379 = ~Well... don't worry about it, then. I'll join you for free this time. You're doing me a favor, really. It's nice to feel wanted for something other than crimes against humanity and elves and that one goblin lair.~ [OH95974]
@1380 = ~Actually, I'd rather not.~
@1381 = ~You're a gift from the gods, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. I foresee a great battle before you. Take these if they'll help. I'll return to the pits and see that no surprises come at you from behind.~ [OH94317]
@1382 = ~Before I forget, take this. I finished it yestereve. Do be careful with it, and remember, Bannor is a dangerous wizard, adamantite or otherwise. Best of luck, my friend.~
@1383 = ~I foresaw this great day, but that doesn't make its arrival any less sweet!~ [OH100623]
@1384 = ~Perhaps Stirv's menagerie can be used against them.~ [OH92944]
@1385 = ~There are enough of us to surround the guards. Why do we delay?~ [OH92945]
@1386 = ~Fools. No matter how well we're treated, we're ultimately just slaves who live and die at the whims of our master.~ [OH90584]
@1387 = ~At last, a voice of reason. No matter how well we're treated, we ultimately live and die at the whims of our new master.~ [OH90591]
@1388 = ~Wonderful. Another person I am sure won't prove to be hopelessly dull and predictable has come to speak with me.~ [OH91705]
@1389 = ~Forget it. I'm leaving.~
@1390 = ~There's no call for sarcasm.~
@1391 = ~Sarcasm from a drow. Shocking.~
@1392 = ~Spare me your sarcasm and I'll spare you your life, drow.~
@1393 = ~Sarcasm? You wound me.~ [OH91709]
@1394 = ~Let's try to start over. Let me ask you a few questions.~
@1395 = ~Not yet I haven't.~
@1396 = ~No! Please stay. I've nothing better to do than answer each question that flits through your feeble mind.~ [OH91713]
@1397 = ~Ah, what a retort! I'll have to steal it.~ [OH91714]
@1398 = ~Speak, please, I beg you! I can wait no longer!~ [OH94747]
@1399 = ~I'd like to know more about you.~
@1400 = ~I've got to know... how did you end up here?~
@1401 = ~What is it you're looking at?~
@1402 = ~I've... acquired a feather. A feather from a planetar's wing.~
@1403 = ~I have need of your expertise. Can you create poisons?~
@1404 = ~I have the poison ingredients you required.~
@1405 = ~I would like your assistance in my next match.~
@1406 = ~If you wish to know more about me, it only stands to reason that I long to divulge my most closely kept secrets to you. Indeed, I've been standing here hoping I could recount my life story to a complete stranger.~ [OH94754]
@1407 = ~I didn't expect your life story, but some common knowledge would be appreciated.~
@1408 = ~Perhaps we could speak about something else.~
@1409 = ~Never mind, then. I'll be going.~
@1410 = ~You are a self-involved fool, you know that?~
@1411 = ~Ask foolish questions, expect foolish answers. Now begone. You bother me.~ [OH94759]
@1412 = ~No knowledge of me is remotely "common." I have lived for centuries and accumulated a store of knowledge so great that renowned wizards journey from all corners of Faerûn seeking an audience.~ [OH94760]
@1413 = ~Forgive my impertinence. With your permission, I'd like to ask you something.~
@1414 = ~Your humility is truly stunning. Unfortunately, I must take my leave of you.~
@1415 = ~No, you are not common. Narcissistic and self-absorbed, yes, but not common.~
@1416 = ~I suppose this is the curse of my imprisonment here, to be forced to tolerate the rabble around me.~ [OH94764]
@1417 = ~There's no need to be rude. I'm just trying to make conversation.~
@1418 = ~Never mind. I'd hate to bore you with my prattling.~
@1419 = ~Your ego didn't save you from the Winged, drow.~
@1420 = ~Rude? I merely state the facts. But perhaps I have been overly hasty. Looking about me, I see little opportunity for conversation more engaging than that you offer.~ [OH94768]
@1421 = ~Therefore, I will share the tale of my betrayal and subsequent incarceration. Yes, you heard correctly. I said "betrayal." The Winged, that capricious and wanton mercenary, is no stranger to me. ~ [OH94769]
@1422 = ~I have advised her on occasion, and she has provided certain useful services to me. In recent decades, my experiments required certain unusual reagents. Powdered unicorn horn among them.~ [OH94770]
@1423 = ~You can imagine my excitement when I received word that the Winged had secured some for me. I rushed to meet her—and her band of hunters, as it turned out.~ [OH94771]
@1424 = ~I was not defenseless; I never am. I injured one of her cohorts and immobilized two others before they breached my wards and brought me to these infernal halls.~ [OH94772]
@1425 = ~An entertaining story, if a familiar one. May I ask you something else?~
@1426 = ~A fine tale. I must be going now, however.~
@1427 = ~Such a simple trap to snare the most ingenious of mages. I imagine you'd blush, were you capable of it.~
@1428 = ~How fortunate for you I stand here day and night waiting, nay, hoping you might come to me with some task so I could be of use to you.~ [OH94776]
@1429 = ~Ah... yes... so can you make the poison? I'd appreciate it greatly.~
@1430 = ~Very funny. Can you make the poison or not?~
@1431 = ~Whatever use you might be to me cannot possibly justify this abuse. Farewell.~
@1432 = ~For you, my dear friend? No. For my other dear friend, the one that glitters? Perhaps. That is, if enough of my glittering friends gathered together in one place. 1,500 of them, to be exact.~ [OH94780]
@1433 = ~1,500 gold pieces? A fair price. Here you go.~
@1434 = ~Eh, I need to go...~
@1435 = ~Eh, perhaps another time.~
@1436 = ~Listen carefully. I require certain ingredients to make this poison. Gather some lotus root and distilled alcohol. The merchants may have such things. Bring them to me when you've found them.~ [OH94782]
@1437 = ~Excellent. The poison is prepared but for these ingredients. Just give me a moment to add them... There! Finished.~ [OH94783]
@1438 = ~Thank you, Gezzthemin.~
@1439 = ~Of course you seek my support in the pits. It is the surest way to secure an easy and safe yet dazzling and spectacular victory, for which Dennaton will reward you handsomely. ~ [OH94785]
@1440 = ~You realize such luxuries do not come cheaply, of course... 1,700 gold pieces is my price. A bargain in any estimation!~ [OH94786]
@1441 = ~1,700 gold pieces? That sounds like about right. Here you go.~
@1442 = ~I don't have 1,700 gold pieces at the moment. I'll return when I do.~
@1443 = ~I don't want your help that much. Farewell.~
@1444 = ~I'd rather focus on the enemies before me without worrying about a dagger in the back.~
@1445 = ~I've often wondered what it is about a brilliant wizard deep in thought that compels every passerby to inquire as to his current activity.~ [OH94790]
@1446 = ~The umber hulk in the holding area. I was contemplating the interface between its gaze and the resulting coupled resonance excited in the Weave which stimulates the appropriate brainwaves, resulting in the confusion of its target.~ [OH94791]
@1447 = ~Aldar N'Vosh—a little-known but prolific writer on the subject—hypothesized that the phenomenon of the umber hulk's gaze affecting the Weave in this manner suggests arcane—~ [OH94792]
@1448 = ~And now you stand there agape, trying to grasp the first word of the first sentence I uttered to you. This is a waste of my time and yours. A poor outcome for me, as my time has actual value.~ [OH94793]
@1449 = ~Actually, I was surprised at your quoting Aldar N'Vosh. Wasn't he discredited by Ulrich Fenheld?~
@1450 = ~Ah... right... I would like to ask you something else.~
@1451 = ~I have little time for such speculations. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@1452 = ~What nonsense. That umber hulk's addled your brains.~
@1453 = ~You have read Fenheld's treatise? Splendid! I must admit, when he introduced the hypothesis of multilateral universalism and the duality of arcane reduction, I was skeptical. But by the fourteenth volume, he makes a compelling case.~ [OH94798]
@1454 = ~We should speak again sometime. For now, I would return to my thoughts.~ [OH94799]
@1455 = ~*sigh* Very well. Direct your eyes to the holding pen. What do you see? An ordinary clay golem? Yes. That is certainly what it appears to be.~ [OH94800]
@1456 = ~Even those with knowledge of golemcraft might be fooled. It's little surprise that it takes a mind such as mine to perceive this particular golem's true nature.~ [OH94801]
@1457 = ~It is a shattering golem. I've read about them in Drenaur's "Treatise on Golemcraft."~
@1458 = ~What kind of golem is it?~
@1459 = ~That is very impressive. I would like to speak to you about something else.~
@1460 = ~Never mind. I must be going.~
@1461 = ~Have you ever bored a <PRO_MANWOMAN> to death? Because you're about to.~
@1462 = ~The loss is yours. Well then, why have you sought me out?~ [OH94805]
@1463 = ~Most impressive! That is exactly what it is. When damaged severely, this golem breaks into many smaller ones. A brilliant design—one well worth my attention. My undivided attention. Excuse me.~ [OH94806]
@1464 = ~It is called a "shattering golem."~ [OH94807]
@1465 = ~The most fascinating aspect of its creation is the incorporation of the individual minds of the smaller ones into a hive mind that operates in concert or individually as the situation dictates. Brilliant.~ [OH94808]
@1466 = ~I don't know which is more impressive, the golem or your knowledge of it. Could I talk to you about something else?~
@1467 = ~I'm certain someone would find that fascinating. I'll be going now.~
@1468 = ~They are right. We should marshal all available resources.~ [OH92877]
@1469 = ~Without a doubt.~ [OH92884]
@1470 = ~If I find the little toad, I'll roast him with a well-placed fireball!~ [OH92898]
@1471 = ~Before any of us. Whatever they would do to that toad is nothing compared to what awaits him at my hands.~ [OH92911]
@1472 = ~Time to send some fools to the afterlife.~ [OH92924]
@1473 = ~You hold all our fates in your hands. We are surely doomed.~ [OH92982]
@1474 = ~You have slain our captors, <CHARNAME>. My thanks. You've saved me some effort.~ [OH100618]
@1475 = ~Actually, my name is Gezunteitimin. I was talking about how violent heat causes empyreumatic salts in the beet root.~ [OH95646]
@1476 = ~You have a visitor.~ [OH95648]
@1477 = ~I love the old wizard. He's the only one who has anything worthwhile to say in this place.~ [OH95650]
@1478 = ~Seems the old man's already forgotten about you, <CHARNAME>. I can't say I blame him. Go to the merchants and see if any have Teodgren's Salve of Senile Serenity. That should help him focus, if only briefly.~ [OH95657]
@1479 = ~He doesn't stop. There is genius in him, buried way down. Do you have that drink I recommended?~ [OH95685]
@1480 = ~Not yet.~
@1481 = ~I'm afraid Dulf's mind is clouded again. Do you have any more of Bellowgulp's tonic?~ [OH95688]
@1482 = ~Luckily, I do.~
@1483 = ~Dulf! Here, have a drink!~ [OH95691]
@1484 = ~Why does Bellowgulp insist on giving his potions such ridiculous names? "Salve"? I'm not rubbing it on the old man's head.~ [OH95700]
@1485 = ~Dulf, our friend here brought us a drink! Let us make a toast. To your venerable age, Dulf Ebonbeard—by human standards, at least—and to many long years ahead.~ [OH95701]
@1486 = ~Our good friend here brought it for you. I believe they wish to speak with you.~ [OH95705]
@1487 = ~It is Bannor, isn't it?~ [OH95722]
@1488 = ~Has anyone ever tried to return his mind to his body?~ [OH95726]
@1489 = ~Like yourself, perhaps?~ [OH95728]
@1490 = ~That would require effort on my part. I think not.~ [OH95742]
@1491 = ~Performers?~ [OH90492]
@1492 = ~True. But there are many of them. And the spellcasters among us have been rendered powerless. Better to bide our time and gather information.~ [OH90502]
@1493 = ~And I such wisdom from an orc.~ [OH90504]
@1494 = ~Calm yourself. You actually growled a few two-syllable words there. You don't want to break your brain now, do you?~ [OH90506]
@1495 = ~"A feather from a planetar's wing." In six words you have become infinitely more interesting, <CHARNAME>.~
@1496 = ~You can use it?~
@1497 = ~I'm glad to hear it.~
@1498 = ~I'm going to sell it.~
@1499 = ~And now you bore me once again.~
@1500 = ~You may find me boring, but I think this feather interests you.~
@1501 = ~You've got a better use for it?~
@1502 = ~As luck would have it, I was just researching a new spell...~
@1503 = ~I might be able to devise something that would help one fight the planetar whose wing that feather came from.~
@1504 = ~If one were so inclined to fight said planetar...?~
@1505 = ~Do it.~
@1506 = ~I think I'll just sell it, thanks.~
@1507 = ~As you wish. Come see me on the morrow.~
@1508 = ~Perhaps it does at that.~
@1509 = ~Ah, there you are. And here is that scroll we discussed the other day. Use it wisely.~
@1510 = ~As wisely as anyone planning to battle a planetar can use anything, at any rate.~
@1511 = ~You there! If you need to rest, go to the bunks.~
@1512 = ~I'm sorry, I seem to be lost. Can you escort me there?~
@1513 = ~All right. I'll be on my way then.~
@1514 = ~This way! Follow me.~
@1515 = ~What's the matter, slaves? Nowhere to go? That whole rebellion thing doesn't look so good now, does it?~
@1516 = ~When reinforcements arrive, you'll be sorry. Then we'll—argh!~
@1517 = ~When reinforcements arrive, you'll be sorry. Then we'll—~
@1518 = ~Smash the door! I'll crack their skulls like eggs!~
@1519 = ~I care not how the guards have prepared. I will unleash a torrent of slaughter upon them such as they have never seen!~
@1520 = ~I am Hort Il-D'rth, First of the Bone Scars. My arms count twenty-nine scar rings. I am the many-scarred warrior of my clan. Three females lie in my hut.~ [OH92614]
@1521 = ~My name is Hort Il-D'rth! First of the Bone Scars! No walls can contain me!~ [OH92615]
@1522 = ~I would know more about you, Hort Il-D'rth, First of the Bone Scars.~
@1523 = ~I like your attitude. Would you be willing to fight with me during my next match?~
@1524 = ~What do you want of Hort Il-D'rth?~ [OH92617]
@1525 = ~I would know more about you.~
@1526 = ~Nothing.~
@1527 = ~Hort does not speak to those who are without scars.~ [OH92619]
@1528 = ~And you are female. Females are not warriors. They bear the children of warriors.~ [OH92620]
@1529 = ~Mine-dwellers are the enemies of Hort's people. But this place is strange place. Enemies may become allies. MAY.~ [OH92621]
@1530 = ~They SAY you are a great warrior, but how do I know it is true? You do not wear the scar rings.~ [OH92623]
@1531 = ~Prove yourself. Then maybe I, Hort Il-D'rth, First of the Bone Scars, will speak with you.~ [OH92624]
@1532 = ~I do not like the idea of these trials, but I will fight hard, and I will survive.~
@1533 = ~You will soon realize I can hold my own in the arena.~
@1534 = ~Pray you never face me in the arena. I would enjoy shaming you.~
@1535 = ~Hort Il-D'rth, First of the Bone Scars, is eager to see that.~ [OH92628]
@1536 = ~The anger in your voice is a warrior's rage. You may prove to be one still.~ [OH92629]
@1537 = ~You do not wear the scars. Prove yourself in the arena!~ [OH92630]
@1538 = ~Hort will join you the next time you enter the arena.~ [OH92631]
@1539 = ~I see the scars of combat upon you. You are worthy of Hort Il-D'rth, First of the Bone Scars.~ [OH92632]
@1540 = ~<CHARNAME>, what would you have of me?~ [OH92633]
@1541 = ~I am the many-scarred warrior of the Bone Scars clan, and three females lie in my hut. My arms count twenty-nine scar rings. That is all that matters.~ [OH92634]
@1542 = ~Where are you from?~
@1543 = ~How did you earn these rings on your arms?~
@1544 = ~If you say so. Farewell.~
@1545 = ~You fought well last time. Hort will fight with you again—but there must be gold this time too.~ [OH92635]
@1546 = ~Here. 1,000 gold pieces.~
@1547 = ~I can give you 500 gold pieces. Is that enough?~
@1548 = ~I have no gold at the moment.~
@1549 = ~You want money from me? I don't think so.~
@1550 = ~It is possible. But first, you must take this oath: that you make those who hold us here your sworn enemies, and that when the day comes, you will stand by Hort's side when I deal them death's blows.~ [OH92637]
@1551 = ~Then, once we are free, we will find their families, and burn their homes, and dig up the bones of their ancestors, and grind them to powder beneath our heel. Swear to this.~ [OH92638]
@1552 = ~I swear it.~
@1553 = ~I live to be free again just like you. I will fight when it is time, this I promise.~
@1554 = ~The thought of revenge keeps me strong. I swear they will all suffer for what they've done.~
@1555 = ~I will not make such an oath.~
@1556 = ~Hort does not hear the warrior's anger in your voice.~ [OH92643]
@1557 = ~You speak well, like a warrior of the Bone Scars.~ [OH92644]
@1558 = ~One more thing is needed to seal our pact. On the outside, Bone Scars raid; we take what we need. Here, I must have gold to pay the merchants.~ [OH92645]
@1559 = ~Here, take these 1,000 gold pieces.~
@1560 = ~Good enough. We will fight together next time you enter the arena.~ [OH92647]
@1561 = ~Hort will not fight for you until you have the gold. But you have taken an oath—Hort will hold you to it.~ [OH92648]
@1562 = ~As you wish. Hort Il-D'rth, First of the Bone Scars, will not fight with you for now. But you have taken an oath. You will be held to it.~ [OH92649]
@1563 = ~I am from the land of the Bone Scars. The lands of our clan are the lands we take. That is our way.~ [OH92650]
@1564 = ~I see. Then how did you end up here?~
@1565 = ~And a savage way it is. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@1566 = ~Hort Il-D'rth and his scar brothers raided a slave trader encampment near our lands. It was a trap. The slavers changed into the winged woman and her followers. They killed Hort Il-D'rth's scar brothers.~ [OH92652]
@1567 = ~They surrounded Hort Il-D'rth, but not before I bloodied them. The Thayan was dying on his knees before me, which is the proper place of all Thayans.~ [OH92653]
@1568 = ~I raised my axe high and screamed to Gruumsh that I was about to join him in endless war! The winged one and her followers were scared of Hort! They used magic to put me to sleep. They denied me a warrior's death. Cowards!~ [OH92654]
@1569 = ~They captured me using similar tactics.~
@1570 = ~I was ambushed the same way, but my party survived.~
@1571 = ~So they outsmarted you. Not too hard to do, I think.~
@1572 = ~Then you know Hort's anger—the desire to deal death's blow to the winged one and her followers.~ [OH92658]
@1573 = ~I do indeed. What do you make of this place?~
@1574 = ~All too well. Farewell, Hort Il-D'rth. We may speak again.~
@1575 = ~The winged female feared Hort and his scar brothers. Bringing us all here would have made these rooms flow red with blood.~ [OH92659]
@1576 = ~That may happen yet. What do you make of this place?~
@1577 = ~I've heard enough for now. Thank you.~
@1578 = ~The winged female was afraid to face Hort. Her only chance was treachery. She is a coward, and I will crush her.~ [OH92660]
@1579 = ~Good luck with that. You'll need it.~
@1580 = ~Hort Il-D'rth, First of the Bone Scars, is a warrior. To be a warrior is to be free. Warriors do not fight in cages for the amusement of others. I will crush those who seek to deal death's blow to Hort, but the fighting here is meaningless.~ [OH92661]
@1581 = ~An interesting perspective. Thank you.~
@1582 = ~Scar rings record a warrior's great deeds. They are carved with the warrior's own blade, still dripping with his enemy's blood.~ [OH92662]
@1583 = ~A grotesque practice. Farewell.~
@1584 = ~Then we talk no longer.~ [OH92663]
@1585 = ~I'm ready to crush and maim!~
@1586 = ~I'm ready to crush and maim! More scar rings for me!~
@1587 = ~No promises!~
@1588 = ~I promise I WILL kill the worm if I find him!~
@1589 = ~Finally it's time for blood!~
@1590 = ~If only I could be the one to crush Dennaton's skull. I envy you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1591 = ~You delivered death to our captors, <CHARNAME>. You have my respect.~
@1592 = ~You dare try to command Hort Il-D'rth? I'll rip you open and strangle you with your own entrails!~ [OH90495]
@1593 = ~I'd expect such cowardice from a drow!~ [OH90503]
@1594 = ~That's it! I could use a fight, and need no excuse to kill a drow!~ [OH90505]
@1595 = ~Oh, you kill orcs, do you? Maybe you'd like to try me out, you ale-drenched whale!~ [OH90578]
@1596 = ~Enough talk! More killing!~ [OH90588]
@1597 = ~Hello! The name's Hue Greenleaf. I've got armor made by the finest smiths from Waterdeep to Kara-Tur! I've scoured all Faerûn for the very best, so buy with confidence! ~
@1598 = ~Sounds good. Let me see what you've got.~
@1599 = ~How'd you get here?~
@1600 = ~Perhaps I will, another time.~
@1601 = ~The same way as you, I imagine. But Dennaton allows me to leave occasionally, so long as I use my contacts to your—and ultimately his—advantage. So what can I give you today?~
@1602 = ~I'm not sure. Let me look at your selection.~
@1603 = ~His advantage?~
@1604 = ~We're not to talk with the performers, and the guards are already eyeing me, but all right, here's how it is. Dennaton gets all our profit—everything above our procurement cost—and we get to live. You win prize money in the arena, you buy from us, he gets the money back. It's a great deal for him. Now, really, are you going to buy?~
@1605 = ~Maybe. Let me see your selection.~
@1606 = ~Not right now. Another time, perhaps.~
@1607 = ~Let me see your selection of magical trinkets.~

@1608 = ~What's an illithid doing here?~
@1609 = ~Shouldn't you be able to communicate telepathically?~
@1610 = ~I've no time for this.~
@1611 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, your mind is clear to me. I know you seek my rune to the vault so you may exchange it for the key to the upper floor.~
@1612 = ~So you CAN speak telepathically.~
@1613 = ~Are you going to give me away?~
@1614 = ~Well, that saved some time. What do I need to do to get it?~
@1615 = ~Ellraish does want it, but I'm actually here to shop.~
@1616 = ~Stay out of my mind, illithid.~
@1617 = ~Most of you slaves are so very uninteresting. Your recent discussions with Ellraish changes things.~
@1618 = ~So are you going to give me away?~
@1619 = ~What do I need to do to get your rune?~
@1620 = ~I'm really only interested in shopping.~
@1621 = ~No. I shall keep your secret. It suits my purposes to do so.~
@1622 = ~So what do I need to do to get your rune?~
@1623 = ~Good. I'll be leaving, now.~
@1624 = ~There is something I want even more than the rune. The ring of Stannel Eibor, the scribe. Bring it to me.~
@1625 = ~What's so valuable about his ring?~
@1626 = ~In the meantime, let me see your selection of magical items.~
@1627 = ~It is my price for the rune. That is all you need know.~
@1628 = ~You do not have the scribe's ring? Then we have nothing to discuss, unless you have come to purchase something.~
@1629 = ~Ah, I sense in your mind that you have the ring on you! Give it to me!~
@1630 = ~I have it. Now tell me why you want it.~
@1631 = ~Here it is. Give me the rune.~
@1632 = ~Let me see what items you have for sale first.~
@1633 = ~Maybe later. Maybe.~
@1634 = ~It will allow one person to escape this arena, assuming they know the activation phrase. I have seen it in the scribe's mind, but I'll not reveal it to you. The ring is worthless to you.~
@1635 = ~Why do you wish to escape?~
@1636 = ~Here it is, then. Now hand over the rune.~
@1637 = ~Then let me see something that does have value to me. Show me your wares.~
@1638 = ~Having something you want is reward enough for me.~
@1639 = ~I do not like being enslaved any more than you do. Now let us make the trade.~
@1640 = ~Here. Now hand over the rune.~
@1641 = ~We will—when I choose to make it.~
@1642 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You have done me such a service that I might consider NOT eating your brain if given the chance! Now, unless you would buy something, our business is at an end.~
@1643 = ~We're done. Thank you.~
@1644 = ~I cannot wait to finally escape this madness. Until then, I shall be content to sell you my items at a discount.~
@1645 = ~Sounds good to me. Let's see what you've got.~
@1646 = ~Maybe later. I need to go now.~
@1647 = ~A mushroom? Really? Is this supposed to be funny?~
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pit */
@1648 = ~It sounds fantastic, I know, but it IS true. I can prove it—unless I'm much mistaken, the Hero of Baldur's Gate is among us this very minute. Everyone, say hello to <CHARNAME>—our tale's protagonist in the flesh!~
@1649 = ~It is true. How did you know it was me?~
@1650 = ~What? Where?~
@1651 = ~I'm not suggesting you should bow before me, but it wouldn't be inappropriate.~
@1652 = ~Your fame has spread far and wide!~
@1653 = ~Would you two like to fight while our bounty escapes, or can we get down to business? ~
@1654 = ~Hah. And they call me a Joker.~
@1655 = ~Ooh, plucky, isn't <PRO_HESHE>? I like it!~
@1656 = ~Gee, leave it to the mark to figure out the plot first! I'd practically fall asleep waiting for some of you to quit wagging your jaws!~
@1657 = ~Come now! I know it's you. I know everything worth knowing, and your fame has spread far and wide.~
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pit */
@1658 = ~Hah! The Bhaalspawn does not lack for ego.~
@1659 = ~Bet it does.~
@1660 = ~I've heard tell of a performer with a drink I've yet to taste. Well, let's see it, then. Amaze me.~
@1661 = ~It's nothing more than a tale told for your amusement.~
@1662 = ~Here. Have a sip. (Slip Rat Poison in the drink)~
@1663 = ~Try some, I'm sure you'll be impressed. (Slip Gezzthemin's Poison in the drink)~
@1664 = ~Take a sip. I think you'll like it. (Slip Feldrak's Poison in the drink)~
@1665 = ~A tall order, but I'll do my best. Here, take a sip. (Slip Brother Ellraish's Poison in the drink)~
@1666 = ~Here it is. Have a sip. (Slip The Concocter's Poison in the drink)~
@1667 = ~Well, that was disappointing. Waste my time again and I'll make your death slow and entertaining.~
@1668 = ~Someone's challenged me to a drinking contest? Can this preposterous claim be true?~
@1669 = ~No, it's true. I can outdrink anyone, even you.~
@1670 = ~Grab a chair. I'll drink your skinny half-elf arse under this table.~
@1671 = ~Hah! You may last long enough for me to quench my thirst, but I'd not bet on it.~
@1672 = ~Bottoms up!~
@1673 = ~Let us begin, then.~
@1674 = ~Less talking, more drinking.~
@1675 = ~Pathetic. It's a marvel you've survived the pit this long.~
@1676 = ~Pfah! This swill isn't fit for Stirv's puppies. I'll waste no more time here!~
@1677 = ~Still upright. Perhaps you're not as useless as those fools Pyrrus and Kun after all. Their constant bickering could drive one to drink.~
@1678 = ~They don't get along with each other?~
@1679 = ~Next round! ~
@1680 = ~Next round! (Slip the rat poison into Joker's drink.)~
@1681 = ~Next round! (Slip Gezzthemin's poison into Joker's drink.)~
@1682 = ~Next round! (Slip Feldrak's poison into Joker's drink.)~
@1683 = ~Next round! (Slip Brother Ellraish's poison into Joker's drink.)~
@1684 = ~Next round! (Slip the Concocter's poison into Joker's drink.)~
@1685 = ~To put it mildly. Thassk was in the salamander armies and Pol was with Thay. Neither will let the war go. Why is my glass empty?~
@1686 = ~Not bad. Better than the time I challenged that adamantine fop, Bannor, to a drinking contest. He poured the finest Cormyrian Firedrake down his maw and it leaked out between his joints!~
@1687 = ~Hey, did you hear the story about Bannor? This is a good one.~
@1688 = ~This brilliant drow wizard placed his mind in an adamantine golem and then couldn't get it back out. And get this: He calls ME stupid. Another round!~
@1689 = ~I expected you to be on the floor by now. You're not what you seem, but who is? Take Dormamus, for example. He pretends to be bound in service to the Winged. The truth? He's free as the rest of us!~
@1690 = ~Really? Why?~
@1691 = ~ 'Cuz it's funny! He's the only one in the crew with any sense of humor. C'mere. I've a joke for you.~
@1692 = ~Dormamus keeps the flask he used to trap that Najim right in his room! Hah!~
@1693 = ~Ah, what do you want? Never said it was a good joke. Another round?~
@1694 = ~Not bad. Not bad at all. Y'know, I once lifted flagons with th' Winged. Would you believe she can't hold her ale? Guess she wuz a celestial—a solar or planetar, some'n like that. C'mon. 'nother round.~
@1695 = ~I AM a bard. The name's Joker. And the joke? I'm afraid it's on you.~
@1696 = ~An ornate iron flask lies on the pedestal. Strange, hypnotic shapes whirl within the translucent metal. A hollow yell reaches your ears: "Let me out! Someone, let me out of here!" You recognize the voice of Najim, the djinni who tried to warn you of the Planar Hunters' attack in the tavern.~
@1697 = ~Najim, is that you?~
@1698 = ~(Open the bottle.)~
@1699 = ~(Leave the bottle alone.)~
@1700 = ~Najim does not appear to hear or see you.~
@1701 = ~The bottle is now filled with swirling flames and smoke. Smoldering red eyes glare at you, as if trying to burn through the bottle's iron. A voice filled with rage bellows: "I will find you Najim, you and the <PRO_RACE> you've bound yourself to! I will find you and watch you burn for eternity!"~
@1702 = ~Watch what you say, knight. You will pray to Garagos one day.~
@1703 = ~That is the ecstasy of Garagos! Glorious must have been their rage!~
@1704 = ~Greetings! You're part of the new group, right? Garagos is truly great, sending us ever more warriors to continue the glorious slaughter.~
@1705 = ~But who guides him, do you think? Garagos, of course! They've built these arenas as shrines to him!~
@1706 = ~What is it you want? Are you one of Garagos's reavers?~
@1707 = ~Never! The god of destruction is a vile aberration.~
@1708 = ~There is nothing but war, no one but Tempus. May the blood of his enemies drip from his blade for time eternal.~
@1709 = ~No, my faith belongs to another of the gods.~
@1710 = ~I am! Glory be to Garagos, may he see us bathe in the blood of thousands slain in battle, brother.~
@1711 = ~Is that what you think? May he feast on your heart one day. This conversation is over.~
@1712 = ~Another one! Would that I was free to cleave through you all in Garagos's name! Instead, I must endure within this conclave of worshippers of the Usurper! Is there no one who prays to the only worthy god? Maybe the orc they just brought in—Horton, or whatever his name is.~
@1713 = ~I heard someone besides Dennaton was behind this place?~
@1714 = ~I found this gauntlet with strange writing on it and was wondering if you could decipher any of it.~
@1715 = ~You would do well to put your faith in Garagos. Don't listen to these fools—it's the followers of Garagos who do best in this place, his own house. Why, Dorn Graybrook himself turned to Garagos when he was brought here. That's how he survived long enough to be freed.~
@1716 = ~Don't listen to her. She's a simple wench in love with the village idiot, her beloved Tempus. Did you want anything else from me?~
@1717 = ~I heard someone besides Dennaton was behind this place. Can you tell me anything about that?~
@1718 = ~Come here, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>! Let me give you the reavers' welcome—~
@1719 = ~Keep talking, wench. Your words are like your god: feeble. <CHARNAME> and I are one. You should fear us.~
@1720 = ~I heard someone else besides Dennaton was behind this place?~
@1721 = ~Molzahn takes care of the healing. Ask him.~
@1722 = ~Molzahn keeps our store. I don't bother with that.~
@1723 = ~I know nothing of that and would be a fool to speak of it if I did. I'm sure Curell would be more than happy to discuss it with you.~
@1724 = ~Ugh... No, I cannot! The writing is celestial, but it has the stench of Torm all over it. I suggest you ask Curell what her decrepit god wants with an actual instrument of war!~
@1725 = ~Begone! Insult my god again, and I'll cut your tongue from your wretched mouth!~
@1726 = ~Welcome back, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> in blood. Let us chant Garagos's battle cry together. Did you want to ask me something before we do?~
@1727 = ~What is it? By the way, your arena slaughters strengthen Garagos, even if you do not wish to recognize it.~
@1728 = ~Now is the time for destruction! Take this gift of Garagos so the slaughter won't be interrupted by tending to wounds!~
@1729 = ~The time has come for destruction and slaughter, <CHARNAME>! I envy you!~
@1730 = ~Garagos is truly great! He sends us ever more warriors to continue the glorious slaughter!~
@1731 = ~Who do you think guides them? Garagos, of course! These arenas are shrines to him!~
@1732 = ~The carnage and death you have wrought here is glorious in the sight of Garagos!~
@1733 = ~Before the slaughter, let us heal your wounds so the violence may continue unabated. Come, you two. Join me in restoring these heroes to health.~
@1734 = ~So you're Brodle's friend, eh? The name's Leokas. What's this about?~ [OH92337]
@1735 = ~This requires secrecy.~
@1736 = ~Do you command the entire guard around here?~
@1737 = ~What would it take for you to support a rebellion against Dennaton?~
@1738 = ~Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all. I need to go.~
@1739 = ~I'm not a fool, mate. I know the game. This meeting never took place... for now. Whether that remains true or not depends on what you have to say.~ [OH92338]
@1740 = ~No. The guards come from several mercenary corps Dennaton's hired. Each protects certain areas or take certain shifts. I command one such group.~ [OH92339]
@1741 = ~Figured it'd be something along those lines from the way Brodle was talking. Let's cut to the chase. First, I'll need 100 gold pieces to guarantee I remain silent about this meeting.~ [OH92340]
@1742 = ~You already agreed this meeting was secret. Why must I pay you now?~
@1743 = ~If I pay you now, what's to keep you from demanding another 100 gold in exchange for continued silence in the future?~
@1744 = ~Please, this is not the way for us to get off to a good start. If we are to work together, there must be trust.~
@1745 = ~How about if I don't pay you 100 gold and instead agree not to kill you?~
@1746 = ~Fine. Here's your 100 gold.~
@1747 = ~I don't have 100 gold pieces on me.~
@1748 = ~Forget it.~
@1749 = ~Because I say so. 100 gold pieces and my mouth stays shut.~ [OH92344]
@1750 = ~What's to keep you from demanding more in the future?~
@1751 = ~This isn't the way to get us off to a good start. If we are to work together, there must be trust.~
@1752 = ~We're both reasonable people. I'm sure we can come to some agreement. How does this sound: I don't pay you 100 gold and instead agree not to kill you?~
@1753 = ~Absolutely nothing. In fact, I'll remember that in case I lose big at cards tonight. Now pay up.~ [OH92347]
@1754 = ~But you already agreed this meeting was secret. Why should I bribe you just to stay quiet?~
@1755 = ~Please, this is not the way to get off to a good start. If we are to work together, there must be trust.~
@1756 = ~All right, then. I'll forgo the cash... but my soldiers are another matter entirely. They're mercenaries. Money is the only thing they find persuasive. To guarantee their loyalty, you'll need to pay us more than Dennaton. 20,000 gold should cover it.~ [OH92350]
@1757 = ~I'm leading a rebellion on these slaves' behalf. Surely you can waive such an exorbitant fee.~
@1758 = ~You've seen my prowess in the arena. You know I am an instrument of death. If I were you and your soldiers, I'd want to stay on my good side.~
@1759 = ~Here is your 20,000 gold, then.~
@1760 = ~I'll need time to raise that kind of coin.~
@1761 = ~Forget it. I shall not pay that amount.~
@1762 = ~So much whining! Look, this IS about trust. If you can't pay me a paltry 100 gold, how can I "trust" you can get the coin required to buy my soldiers' loyalty?~ [OH92351]
@1763 = ~I don't have that much money.~
@1764 = ~Easy there. I was only kidding. Forget the 100 gold. But my soldiers—they're another matter. Money's the only thing they'll find remotely persuasive. You'll need to pay more than Dennaton. 20,000 gold at least.~ [OH92352]
@1765 = ~Kill me and you'll be swarmed by so many guards your rebellion will be over before it begins. And my silence will now cost you 200 gold.~ [OH92353]
@1766 = ~Fine. Here's your 200 gold.~
@1767 = ~I don't have 200 gold pieces on me.~
@1768 = ~Excellent! Now we can discuss business. Here's the bottom line: My soldiers are mercenaries. To guarantee their loyalty, you'll need to pay more than Dennaton. 20,000 gold should get the job done.~ [OH92356]
@1769 = ~Then you've got a problem, friend. Go sell some equipment to the merchants or win some more prize money in the arena and bring me my fee. I'll be around awhile, but be quick. I'd hate to have to go to Dennaton with what I know.~ [OH92357]
@1770 = ~That's a shame. I'm sure Dennaton will pay handsomely for the knowledge you're plotting to rebel. Think on it a bit. If you come to your senses, I'll be around... for a time.~ [OH92358]
@1771 = ~By the Nine Hells, you sure are a silver-tongued devil. Look, my soldiers have to eat. I can cut the cost to match Dennaton's—15,000 gold pieces. Anything less and my people would string me up!~ [OH92359]
@1772 = ~Here is your 15,000 gold, then.~
@1773 = ~Forget it. I'll not pay, not that much.~
@1774 = ~Perhaps I could, but I won't. I've more sympathy for my soldiers than I do these slaves. We all have our lots in life. My followers' lot is to fight for pay. 20,000 gold buys our loyalty.~ [OH92360]
@1775 = ~You do have a certain air about you—an aura of leadership that will doubtless rally the other slaves behind you. But I can't simply forgo the fee. My soldiers need to eat. I'll cut it—you just have to match Dennaton's pay. 15,000 gold pieces.~ [OH92361]
@1776 = ~Sorry. Your record in the arena means little compared to the number of guards Dennaton has on hand. I'm willing to swing the odds in your favor, for 20,000 gold. No less.~ [OH92362]
@1777 = ~A pleasure doing business with you. I'll go explain the new deal to my people—this coin will make the switch easier to swallow. We'll go about our business as normal for now, but when the uprising begins, we'll be there. Farewell.~ [OH92363]
@1778 = ~Certainly. I'll be around. Come find me when you have the money. But know my soldiers won't fight for you if you don't deliver payment before the rebellion begins. Good luck.~ [OH92364]
@1779 = ~That's a shame. I'll be around in case you change your mind. If you don't deliver the payment, however, I guarantee my soldiers won't fight for you when the rebellion begins. Good luck.~ [OH92365]
@1780 = ~That's a shame, and after I cut you such a good deal. Well, I'll be around if you change your mind. The price is back to 20,000 gold, and no argument from you will get it lower. If you don't deliver the payment, I guarantee that my soldiers won't fight for you when the uprising begins. Good luck.~ [OH92366]
@1781 = ~You're back, are you? Thought better of our meeting, or do you still plan to waste my time?~ [OH92367]
@1782 = ~I just really need to be sure that you will keep this meeting a secret.~
@1783 = ~That depends. Do you command the entire guard around here?~
@1784 = ~I wouldn't want to waste your time. Farewell. ~
@1785 = ~You're back. And you have my money?~ [OH92371]
@1786 = ~Yes, here are your 100 gold pieces.~
@1787 = ~No, I still need more time.~
@1788 = ~No chance.~
@1789 = ~You're back. Excellent! You've brought my 200 gold?~ [OH92373]
@1790 = ~I've got your gold.~
@1791 = ~Ah, the one I've been waiting for! Have you the 20,000 gold pieces that will win the loyalty of my guards?~ [OH92375]
@1792 = ~Yes, here is your 20,000 gold payment.~
@1793 = ~No, I still need more time to raise that kind of coin.~
@1794 = ~Ah, the one I've been waiting for! Have you brought the 15,000 gold that will win the hearts and more importantly, the blades of my guards?~ [OH92377]
@1795 = ~I have.~
@1796 = ~That's right, finish them off!~ [OH92954]
@1797 = ~Well met, <CHARNAME>. When I heard the rebellion was underway, I secured the barracks here. We're ready to take the fight to Dennaton!~ [OH92955]
@1798 = ~Excellent. Where is he?~
@1799 = ~We need to kill the guards in the other room first.~
@1800 = ~Thanks for your help, but you didn't really expect me to let you live, did you? Die, fools!~
@1801 = ~Let's go, then! Follow me!~
@1802 = ~Still lording over the arena, I imagine. I doubt he heard the alarm signaling your rebellion over the crowd. We can probably catch him by surprise.~ [OH92957]
@1803 = ~Thanks for your help. Now die, fools!~
@1804 = ~The captain thinks he can contain you here until reinforcements arrive. He's wrong. There are actually two ways into that room.~ [OH92958]
@1805 = ~You can sweep through the kitchen to hit him from behind, but you'll have to deal with Stirv's beasts along the way. Alternatively, there's a lever in the corner over there that'll pop the door across the hall and allow a frontal assault, but beware: The captain'll be prepared for attacks from that direction.~ [OH92959]
@1806 = ~Where's Dennaton?~
@1807 = ~Thanks for your help. You can die now.~
@1808 = ~Follow me!~
@1809 = ~Treacherous swine! To the death, then!~ [OH92961]
@1810 = ~This is the moment we've been waiting for. Kill them all!~ [OH92938]
@1811 = ~Good luck facing Dennaton, <CHARNAME>!~ [OH92980]
@1812 = ~A new <PRO_GIRLBOY>, I take it? Report to one of the other servants, if you haven't already.~
@1813 = ~Already have, thanks.~
@1814 = ~I will, thank you.~
@1815 = ~You've been allowed up here, slave, but we're keeping an eye on you.~
@1816 = ~You must be the new <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Has anyone spoken to you about the... particularities of their rooms?~
@1817 = ~Tell me about Bannor's room.~
@1818 = ~Tell me about Pol Pyrrus's room.~
@1819 = ~Tell me about Thassk Kun's room.~
@1820 = ~Tell me about Dormamus's room.~
@1821 = ~Tell me about Joker's room.~
@1822 = ~Tell me about the Winged's room.~
@1823 = ~Tell me about Dennaton's room.~
@1824 = ~I know everything I need to. Thanks.~
@1825 = ~You must be the new <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Have you been briefed on your duties? Do you have any questions?~
@1826 = ~I'll be fine. Thank you.~
@1827 = ~All Sir Bannor's furniture is sculpted from granite blocks in order to accommodate his formidable size. Do NOT climb them. Anything else you need to know you can learn from his personal servant.~
@1828 = ~What about Pol Pyrrus's Room?~
@1829 = ~Is there anything I should know about Thassk Kun's Room?~
@1830 = ~Tell me about Dormamus's quarters.~
@1831 = ~Is Joker's room as messy as I think it is?~
@1832 = ~Have you been in the Winged's chambers?~
@1833 = ~That will be all. Thank you.~
@1834 = ~You can only enter Sir Pyrrus' room at his request—a special key's necessary to open the lock. Even unlocked, his door can only be opened with great exertion—it is solid iron. Once inside, you will notice His Lordship likes his quarters warm, though not to same degree as Sir Kun.~
@1835 = ~Interesting. Tell me about Bannor's room.~
@1836 = ~Sir Kun likes his room hot, I take it?~
@1837 = ~What about Dormamus's room?~
@1838 = ~Joker's quarters are a disaster area, aren't they? Admit it.~
@1839 = ~Can you tell me anything about the Winged's chambers?~
@1840 = ~What are Dennaton's quarters like?~
@1841 = ~Sir Pyrrus enjoys a certain amount of heat; Sir Kun likes things blazing hot. Don proper handwear when opening the door or you'll suffer severe burns. Don't be frightened by the fires inside; they pose no threat as long as you step carefully. The heat will... inconvenience you, however.~
@1842 = ~I take it Bannor's quarters aren't so hot?~
@1843 = ~Sir Pyrrus likes heat in his room?~
@1844 = ~Is there anything I should know about Dormamus's room?~
@1845 = ~Has anyone been in Joker's room and survived?~
@1846 = ~Tell me what you know of the Winged's quarters.~
@1847 = ~What are Dennaton's chambers like?~
@1848 = ~His Lordship's attendants are as numerous as they are lightly clad, but they are there for his enjoyment and his alone. Do not fraternize with them if you value your life.~
@1849 = ~Also, Sir Dormamus's door is magical; it is not opened with a key, but with a word. I gather it's supposed to be a secret, but everyone knows it's "swordfish."~
@1850 = ~What do you know about Bannor's room?~
@1851 = ~Tell me about Pol Pyrrus's quarters.~
@1852 = ~Thassk Kun's room—anything interesting going on in there?~
@1853 = ~Is Joker's room the deathtrap I picture it being?~
@1854 = ~What of the Winged's chambers?~
@1855 = ~Do you know what I'll find in Dennaton's quarters?~
@1856 = ~Her room is a horrendous mess, most unladylike. Do not attempt to tidy it—it's full of... surprises. Unpleasant ones at best. At worst, lethal.~
@1857 = ~Another bit of advice: If Lady Joker ever asks you to fetch something from her room, insist she explain the door's exact opening sequence. Trust me on this.~
@1858 = ~I do. Tell me about Bannor's room.~
@1859 = ~What of Pol Pyrrus's room?~
@1860 = ~Are Thassk Kun's quarters so dangerous?~
@1861 = ~Can you tell me anything about Dormamus's residence?~
@1862 = ~What might I find in Dennaton's chambers?~
@1863 = ~That will be all for now. Thank you.~
@1864 = ~The Winged is unlike any of her followers, or anyone else for that matter. Her Ladyship is quite the mystery to us. There is little to say about her room. It is clean and far from being as elaborate as her followers' quarters.~
@1865 = ~Intriguing. Tell me about Bannor's room.~
@1866 = ~What can you tell me about Pol Pyrrus's quarters?~
@1867 = ~How disappointingly dull. Are Thassk Kun's quarters more interesting?~
@1868 = ~Is there anything I need to know about Dormamus's room?~
@1869 = ~Is Joker's room as messy as she tends to be?~
@1870 = ~What of Dennaton's room?~
@1871 = ~Our master's living quarters are richly decorated and as comfortable as any prince's. Only the most senior among us are permitted within. If you are allowed inside, handle everything with great care.~
@1872 = ~A performer up here? That's... unusual. Oh well. Please be discrete. You don't want to disturb Sir Dennaton or the Hunters.~
@1873 = ~Shhh. We can't talk here.~
@1874 = ~We're sorry! I don't know what we were thinking!~
@1875 = ~Psst! <CHARNAME>! Can we talk?~
@1876 = ~Go ahead.~
@1877 = ~Who are you two?~
@1878 = ~I don't have time for this.~
@1879 = ~We have to make this quick, before the cook starts thinking we've been gone too long.~
@1880 = ~Oh, right, introductions! We're the cook's assistants. I'm Marduuk, and this is Short-Order.~
@1881 = ~Why did you tell him?~
@1882 = ~<CHARNAME>, so pleased to see you. What can I do for you?~
@1883 = ~What you did to Short-Order was reprehensible.~
@1884 = ~I didn't expect you'd shortchange Short-Order like you did.~
@1885 = ~That was well played, how you took over the cook's position.~
@1886 = ~In the kitchen as in the arena, one does what one must to survive.~
@1887 = ~I am looking for a "special" ingredient for a drink I'd like to make.~
@1888 = ~Disgusting. I'm done with you.~
@1889 = ~Nor did I. This place changes you.~
@1890 = ~And not for the better.~
@1891 = ~One does what one must to survive in this place. The kitchen's no different from the arena in that regard.~
@1892 = ~I have nothing else to say.~
@1893 = ~<CHARNAME>. What can I do for you?~
@1894 = ~A drink, eh? What sort of drink?~
@1895 = ~I'd rather not say.~
@1896 = ~Probably best I don't know the details. What do you need?~
@1897 = ~Poison. Can you get me some?~
@1898 = ~Mmmmaybe. Will rat poison do? There's some in the cupboard over there. Help yourself.~
@1899 = ~The performers are rebelling! Grab a cleaver. We're joining them!~
@1900 = ~Thanks again, <CHARNAME>. I'd fight with you in the arena, but I'd only slow you down.~
@1901 = ~Please, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, a moment of your time.~
@1902 = ~You've seen the kind of person the cook is, right? He's... hard. He hates everyone, Dennaton, the Winged, and us most of all.~
@1903 = ~He once stabbed Short-Order in the hand with a salad fork because he reached for some leftover icing!~
@1904 = ~This has gone on for years. He treats his sides of beef better than us.~
@1905 = ~We've seen you in the arena. We think you can help us.~
@1906 = ~The cook IS a tyrant. I'd like to help.~
@1907 = ~I'm not sure about this... But go on.~
@1908 = ~All this is YOUR problem. But I'm curious—what do you have in mind?~
@1909 = ~The cook is terribly allergic to funguswood. It comes from the Underdark and is sometimes ground into a powder to give dishes a special mushroom accent.~
@1910 = ~If you were able to get your hands on a bit of funguswood and slip it into his food, he'd get very ill. We'll never escape this place, but this way we might have some peace... for a while.~
@1911 = ~Very well. I'll help you.~
@1912 = ~Count me out.~
@1913 = ~I knew we could count on you. Bellowgulp the merchant might have some funguswood powder. Just drop it into a pot on the stove when the cook isn't looking.~
@1914 = ~You'll have our undying gratitude if you pull this off. We'll get a nice reward for you, I promise.~
@1915 = ~Please. If you don't help us, who will? What'll we do?~
@1916 = ~We're slaves, like you. And the cook, though he doesn't like to admit it.~
@1917 = ~But we're not fighters. We're chefs, too! At least we were when we were captured. Now all we do is cleaning and preparation work.~
@1918 = ~Now about what we wanted to discuss...~
@1919 = ~The cook and his guard were both allergic to funguswood? Who'd have thought?~
@1920 = ~You should be happy, Short-Order. You don't have to worry about the cook anymore.You only have to deal with me now.~
@1921 = ~Fetch Tartle so I can tell him of these unfortunate events. Then get rid of the bodies. In the meantime, I'll get another pot of stew going.~
@1922 = ~Thank you for your service, <CHARNAME>. Here is your payment.~
@1923 = ~You and your friends can also count on more generous servings from now on. Maybe even an extra treat once in a while.~
@1924 = ~Short-Order, why are you still here? Go fetch Tartle already!~
@1925 = ~Uuh… Wha—~
@1926 = ~Later, <PRO_SIRMAAM>… We'll—~
@1927 = ~Shhh. Not now! He's—~
@1928 = ~There are two doors into that room. Which would be the easiest to take?~ [OH92942]
@1929 = ~The guards expect a frontal assault. I'm sure they've prepared for such.~ [OH92943]
@1930 = ~I haven't time for idle talk.~ [OH92664]
@1931 = ~State your business and be off. I've matters to attend to.~ [OH91896]
@1932 = ~I was hoping to ask you some questions.~
@1933 = ~I'd not keep you from your business. Farewell.~
@1934 = ~As if your pitiful affairs mean anything to me. Off with you.~
@1935 = ~May you find justice... or retribution, as the case may be.~ [OH91900]
@1936 = ~You've a sharp tongue. Be careful. It might get you into trouble some day.~ [OH91901]
@1937 = ~I shall give you some time. Prove yourself worthy of it.~ [OH91902]
@1938 = ~How did you come to this place?~
@1939 = ~Would you be interested in helping me escape this place?~
@1940 = ~I am the most just and merciful Whitedove, Doombringer of Hoar. You may call me Mercy.~ [OH91905]
@1941 = ~Doombringer of Hoar? Tell me of this.~
@1942 = ~Tell me what things might warrant your attention.~
@1943 = ~Very well, I shall leave.~
@1944 = ~Narcissistic AND deluded. A pitiable combination. ~
@1945 = ~Violence repays violence. Evil repays evil. Good repays good. These are the tenets of Hoar, who brings justice and retribution to each according to their actions.~ [OH91910]
@1946 = ~Well said. True justice must be done.~
@1947 = ~Allowances must be made for the context of one's actions.~
@1948 = ~I see. Tell me the just punishment for a man who kills his neighbor's son.~
@1949 = ~I'd like to discuss something else. Anything else, really.~
@1950 = ~I must be leaving.~
@1951 = ~Juvenile delusions, wholly divorced from any semblance of reality.~
@1952 = ~Swift and reciprocal reward and retribution is the foundation of civilized society. Perhaps we'll discuss Hoar's wisdom in greater depth another time. For now, I must attend to other matters.~ [OH91917]
@1953 = ~Allowances? Excuses set forth to falsely acquit the condemned. Allowances exploit, pervert, and impede the course of justice. If you cannot see this, we've nothing more to discuss.~ [OH91918]
@1954 = ~His neighbor must kill the murderer's son. Such is the swift and equitable vengeance of Hoar.~ [OH91919]
@1955 = ~Killing the innocent son of the guilty man isn't a greater injustice?~
@1956 = ~I see. Let us speak of other things.~
@1957 = ~Your ideals' simplicity is exceeded only by their stupidity.~
@1958 = ~You speak in hypotheticals. I deal in reality. Show me this murderer, and I'll show you justice.~ [OH91923]
@1959 = ~I am set apart to wander Faerûn. I seek those justice has overlooked, whether they be an impoverished farmer uncompensated for a wrong or a wealthy merchant who has escaped his just sentence through cunning designs.~ [OH91924]
@1960 = ~As a Doombringer, I mete out justice in those places where lords and landowners have grown lax in their duty. I bring order to the rugged, careless roads where vagrants and ruffians know not the censure of the magistrate.~ [OH91925]
@1961 = ~May we speak of something else?~
@1962 = ~An unenviable task, but I guess someone's got to do it. Thank you for your time.~
@1963 = ~Doombringer? Yawnbringer would be more accurate.~
@1964 = ~After listening to some of the others talking, I think we all came here in much the same way. The winged one's hunters ambushed me. I had just enough time to draw my weapons before I was overwhelmed.~ [OH91929]
@1965 = ~Mark my words, those bounty hunters shall feel retribution in turn. Hoar is not unmindful of my fate here.~ [OH91930]
@1966 = ~Yeah, that's pretty much how I came to be here too. Let's talk of other things.~
@1967 = ~Tell me more.~
@1968 = ~Thank you for the story. I must be going.~
@1969 = ~From the look of things, Hoar couldn't care less about your fate.~
@1970 = ~Ask me again after we've fought together in the arena. It is in combat that your worth will be determined.~ [OH91935]
@1971 = ~Very well. Let's discuss something else, then.~
@1972 = ~Will you assist me in my next arena battle, then?~
@1973 = ~That's fair. I'll talk to you later, then.~
@1974 = ~You'll have no doubt as to my worth when this is done.~
@1975 = ~Will you assist me in my next arena fight?~
@1976 = ~Can you tell me more about yourself?~
@1977 = ~Are you willing to help me escape?~
@1978 = ~My skills do not come free. I will assist you for no less than 1,500 gold pieces.~ [OH92668]
@1979 = ~Done. Here is your gold.~
@1980 = ~And I will return when I've got that much.~
@1981 = ~Which skills are those? Your narcissism, your self-righteousness, or your ability to bore to death all within earshot?~
@1982 = ~What would you know?~ [OH92672]
@1983 = ~I'd like to know more about your capture.~
@1984 = ~Tell me more about your past.~
@1985 = ~It is not my custom to share such information with strangers. Perhaps after I have seen your courage in battle, I'll be more willing to divulge my secrets. Perhaps. ~ [OH92675]
@1986 = ~Combat reveals many things about an individual. I would see more of you before I tell you more of myself.~ [OH92676]
@1987 = ~As you wish. Let's discuss something else, then.~
@1988 = ~Never mind. The story would just put me to sleep anyway. I must be going.~
@1989 = ~You've proven yourself in combat and earned my trust. You've doubtless noticed that I spend many of my leisure hours observing the guards. I have heard their discussions and know their habits. ~ [OH92679]
@1990 = ~They have no particular loyalty to Dennaton and are mediocre warriors at best. ~ [OH92680]
@1991 = ~I have observed their sparring matches. They lack the skill necessary to defeat the performers' combined might. If we can weaken the winged one's bounty hunters, we may stand a chance.~ [OH92681]
@1992 = ~Good to know. May we discuss something else?~
@1993 = ~Many thanks. I must go now.~
@1994 = ~I guess having no friends gives you plenty of spare time to observe such things.~
@1995 = ~I do not share this tale lightly. You fought by my side and proved yourself worthy of it. Consider it a high honor. Many who fought and died in my company knew nothing of my history.~ [OH92684]
@1996 = ~My father was a Rider of Nesmé, honorable and well respected by all who knew him. He was a hero of many crusades against the monsters of the Evermoors and the Lurkwood.~ [OH92685]
@1997 = ~For his valor, he was given command of a company of riders. The former commander, the son of a wealthy merchant, was displeased. He implicated my father in a deed of high treason and got him hanged.~ [OH92686]
@1998 = ~Though I was little more than a girl, I hunted the man and killed him. Since then, I have sought to right other injustices rampant in the world.~ [OH92687]
@1999 = ~I am honored you shared your story with me. I would like to ask you something else.~
@2000 = ~A moving story. I must be going now.~
@2001 = ~Wha... Oh? Are you finally done? By the gods, you're dull.~
@2002 = ~The winged one and her lackeys aside, none who live have heard the tale. You've earned it through the skill and valor you displayed at my side when we fought in the pit.~ [OH92691]
@2003 = ~I received a mission. No, it was more than that—it was a divine compulsion from Hoar. I was to travel to Mulhorand and investigate the priests of Anhur. Knowing Hoar's hatred toward the depraved Anhur and his followers, I hastened toward my destination.~ [OH92692]
@2004 = ~On the trade road north of Skuld, I came across a scene of destruction and despair. A woman sat in the road, cradling a lifeless child to her bosom. Nearby, a man and young boy lay dead.~ [OH92693]
@2005 = ~The woman could tell me little between her wails of despair. They'd been attacked by bandits who rode to the east. I soon discovered their trail. It was dusk when an ill wind blew from my back. I knew something was amiss.~ [OH92694]
@2006 = ~The winged one and her henchmen had slain the travelers and left them there, knowing I was to pass. It was a perfect plan—but they left me alive. I shall avenge the travelers and myself. They shall know justice.~ [OH92695]
@2007 = ~Thank you for honoring me with the tale. May we speak of something else?~
@2008 = ~I am honored; however, now I must take my leave.~
@2009 = ~What a colossal failure! I wouldn't expect Hoar to come calling with any future missions.~
@2010 = ~How many more are there? A few in the arena, but most of us are here.~ [OH92871]
@2011 = ~Are you a coward or a fool, <CHARNAME>? You're clearly one or the other.~ [OH92885]
@2012 = ~Tartle must pay for his crimes. There can be no compromise on this.~ [OH92302]
@2013 = ~Tartle must pay for his crimes. Justice demands it.~ [OH100502]
@2014 = ~Today we avenge the injustices done against us! Victory or death!~ [OH92921]
@2015 = ~Though you face Dennaton alone, you fight for us all. See justice done.~ [OH92981]
@2016 = ~Our oppressors have faced justice at your hand. I salute you.~ [OH100621]
@2017 = ~Welcoming feast?~ [OH90493]
@2018 = ~By what rights do you imprison us?~ [OH90558]
@2019 = ~Try it. You won't get three steps before you're sliced to ribbons. Now go eat your dinner.~
@2020 = ~Proceed south to the banquet hall. You can't miss it.~
@2021 = ~Quit yer jabbering and listen up! All performers are to report to the banquet hall for the welcoming feast!~
@2022 = ~The cook's really outdone himself this time, so enjoy. For some of you, it'll be your last meal. Now get going!~
@2023 = ~Enough.You aren't fighting anyone, orc. Not yet. And you, drow, save the wit for the arena.~
@2024 = ~I'll not say it again. On your way!~
@2025 = ~(The wizened old man gestures to you, then sweeps his hand in the direction of the scrolls piled high on the table.)~
@2026 = ~Sure. I'll take a look at your selection of scrolls.~
@2027 = ~Don't like to talk much, eh?~
@2028 = ~Thanks, but I'm not looking for scrolls right now.~
@2029 = ~(The man opens wide, revealing an empty mouth. His tongue has been cut out and most of his teeth removed. He grins toothlessly and again gestures to his pile of scrolls.)~
@2030 = ~Then I'll take a look at your selection of scrolls.~
@2031 = ~No thanks. I'm not looking for scrolls at the moment.~
@2032 = ~Ah! Greetings, greetings! What good fortune brings you to my humble shrine?~
@2033 = ~It's good to see someone happy in this place.~
@2034 = ~You've a bizarre view of what constitutes good fortune, friend.~
@2035 = ~Tell me what you do here, halfling, or I'll cut you into a pair of quarterlings!~
@2036 = ~Well, you know what they say. Fortune favors the bold. Well, the performers who live say that. The rest just sort of lie on the ground gasping for air until the monsters finish them off.~
@2037 = ~You really aren't helping.~
@2038 = ~Fortune favors no one. It's one of fortune's greatest failings.~
@2039 = ~Are you trying to cheer me up? If so, try harder.~
@2040 = ~Oh yes, oh my! I have forgotten myself, haven't I?~
@2041 = ~Math humor, nice. But I'd save that antagonism for the arena if I were you.~
@2042 = ~I am Molzahn, priest of Tymora. I provide healing, temple services, and spiritual guidance to our performers. I also keep the ceremonial ale and TRY to keep the other priests from killing each other.~
@2043 = ~Healing! Just the person I was looking for.~
@2044 = ~If it weren't for the guards, they'd have destroyed the entire shrine by now.~
@2045 = ~Sounds like you don't care for them.~
@2046 = ~I'm sorry to hear it. Let's talk about something else.~
@2047 = ~You're a halfling? More like a halfwit. Are you done talking yet?~
@2048 = ~Individually, Laris and Curell aren't so bad. But put them together and it's like throwing beet juice on an owlbear.~
@2049 = ~Beet juice on an owlbear?~
@2050 = ~Can we talk about something else?~
@2051 = ~I'm leaving before I end up as crazy as you are!~
@2052 = ~Trust me. It's not pretty.~
@2053 = ~Understood. Let's talk of other things.~
@2054 = ~I'll take your word for it. Farewell.~
@2055 = ~Anything for our bold performers!~
@2056 = ~Why, yes! Here is our inventory.~
@2057 = ~The pit wears on even the most optimistic disposition. Tell me what is troubling you.~
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pits, adding references to BG2 */
@2058 = ~I was recently imprisoned by a powerful mage, Irenicus. Now I'm back in captivity again.~
@2059 = ~I want to become the most profitable performer in the arena.~
@2060 = ~This captivity is driving me mad. I intend to escape at the earliest opportunity.~
@2061 = ~I was captured. Most around here were. Such is life. Misfortune merely accentuates greater good fortune for those intrepid enough to take it.~
@2062 = ~An encouraging attitude. Tell me more of your capture.~
@2063 = ~I would like to talk about something else.~
@2064 = ~Pfft. The pathetic excuse of a failed priest out of his goddess's favor.~
@2065 = ~I am certainly done talking to you.~
@2066 = ~You don't have to be crazy to work here. But it... well, you know. Farewell.~
@2067 = ~You know nothing of her ways. And if that's your attitude, you'll not learn them from me.~
@2068 = ~Well. Whatever problem you have with my voice is at an end. Farewell.~
@2069 = ~Then you'll hear no more words from me. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@2070 = ~It was that Joker. You know, the half-elf drunkard who can't get enough of her own voice?~
@2071 = ~Not your favorite person, I take it?~
@2072 = ~This is clearly a sore topic for you. Let's talk of something else.~
@2073 = ~You accuse another of liking their own voice. That's rich.~
@2074 = ~Picked up on that, did you?~
@2075 = ~My adventuring company and I were hired to investigate turnip bandits plaguing the trade ways around Baldur's Gate.~
@2076 = ~Turnip bandits? That sounds serious.~
@2077 = ~Enough! Cease your incessant yammering!~
@2078 = ~Not every problem involves dragons or evil wizards trying to conquer all Faerûn.~
@2079 = ~We were at an inn for the night when I noticed a half-elf so drunk she could barely stand. "Tymora smiles upon me," I thought. I challenged her to a game of bones and won a sizable amount of gold. She was none too pleased.~
@2080 = ~I wouldn't think so. Go on.~
@2081 = ~This is clearly a touchy subject for you. Let's talk about something else.~
@2082 = ~By the gods, stop. I'm growing more stupid with every word.~
@2083 = ~Next thing I knew, hands of iron lifted me from my chair, stuffed me in a sack, and beat me senseless. I awoke in a room behind this shrine. That pompous arse, Tartle, soon informed me I was the new resident priest of Tymora.~
@2084 = ~What happened to the old one?~
@2085 = ~An entertaining yarn. May I see your other services now?~
@2086 = ~Are you finally finished?~
@2087 = ~Depends on whom you ask. Either he fell into a wyvern cage and got eaten or he was pushed into a wyvern cage and got eaten.~
@2088 = ~Huh... All right. Can I see the other temple services?~
@2089 = ~I thought Tymora was the goddess of luck.~
@2090 = ~And with that, I left.~
@2091 = ~Bad luck and good luck are a matter of perspective. Just ask the wyvern.~
@2092 = ~I'd rather not.~
@2093 = ~You're more ridiculous than a greased gnome on a steep incline!~
@2094 = ~As day follows night, so good fortune follows ill. Look within yourself. See what it is you desire, then boldly stride forth and claim it. Do this and Tymora's grace will shine down upon you.~
@2095 = ~I'll give it a shot. In the meantime, I have need of other services.~
@2096 = ~Thank you. I'll be going now.~
@2097 = ~Her grace doesn't exactly seem to be shining down on you...~
@2098 = ~You are most welcome.~
@2099 = ~Good! Be brave! Take risks. Surprise your opponents with daring and audacity, and Tymora will smile upon you.~
@2100 = ~I'll do that. May I see your other services?~
@2101 = ~Tymora's favor doesn't seem to have done much for you.~
@2102 = ~Lower your voice! We all want to escape—but we must move with care. You no doubt know the power of Dennaton's hunters.~
@2103 = ~There'll be no escape while they're around. But if you are bold and your heart brave, Tymora will favor you.~
@2104 = ~Wise words. What other services do you offer?~
@2105 = ~Ask away!~
@2106 = ~The last few days have been overwhelming. Can you help me make sense of it all?~
@2107 = ~What's a halfling priest of Tymora doing in a Thayan gladiator arena?~
@2108 = ~You mentioned the other two priests often fight. Isn't that a little unusual?~
@2109 = ~I found this gauntlet. Can you decipher the inscription?~
@2110 = ~Never mind, I was just leaving.~
@2111 = ~Hmm... It's a beautiful piece. More artistic than functional... The writing's odd. Clearly Celestial. Such scripts can be interpreted only by those meant to read them. Which I'm apparently not.~
@2112 = ~Hm. Well, thanks anyway. May I see your other services?~
@2113 = ~How may I be of service?~
@2114 = ~I've wounds that require healing.~
@2115 = ~I have heard that Tymora favors the bold. I have a bold plan that needs favoring.~
@2116 = ~Tymora be with you!~
@2117 = ~You certainly have my attention.~
@2118 = ~The plan is a secret, but it requires ale.~
@2119 = ~I want to poison Joker. I'll need some ale to do it.~
@2120 = ~Forget it. If I tell you, the whole staff will know within the hour.~
@2121 = ~I'll require a game of bones to determine if the Lady Tymora favors your plan. Win and the ale is yours.~
@2122 = ~I'll require a game of bones to determine if the Lady Tymora favors your plan. Win and the ale is yours. Lose, and 1,000 gold pieces will earn you mine.~
@2123 = ~Very well. Let's throw the bones!~
@2124 = ~I've changed my mind.~
@2125 = ~Fortune seems to have favored my throw. Tymora does not approve of your plans—or perhaps she wishes they be made known to me, hmm?~
@2126 = ~If I tell you my plan, you'll give me the ale?~
@2127 = ~No. The plan must remain a secret.~
@2128 = ~You cheating halfling! You've tampered with the bones.~
@2129 = ~The odds are very favorable that I will.~
@2130 = ~Very well. I am trying to weaken our captors by poisoning Joker, and the plan requires ale.~
@2131 = ~No. My plan must remain a secret.~
@2132 = ~And invite Tymora's ire? Never! Now I'll bid you good <DAYNIGHTALL>. Come back if you change your mind about telling me what you're up to.~
@2133 = ~I'll not stand here and listen to such slander! Come back if you change your mind about telling me what you're up to.~
@2134 = ~Come back if you change it again.~
@2135 = ~A pity. Come back when you do or are ready to tell me your plan.~
@2136 = ~As you wish. 1,000 gold pieces, please.~
@2137 = ~On second thought, I've changed my mind.~
@2138 = ~You would poison Joker? That's fantastic! Here, take the ale. May Tymora's blessing be upon you!~
@2139 = ~I have little aid to offer you, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps these gifts will provide some small blessing.~
@2140 = ~Oy. I should lay off the ale!~
@2141 = ~Please! My colleagues! Sir Timmoth! We've been through this how many times now? You're all different sides of the same coin. Tymora blesses you all. Now let our guest speak. I believe <PRO_HESHE> addressed you, Sir Laris.~
@2142 = ~Please! Colleagues! We've gone over this how many times now? You're all just different sides of the same coin. Tymora blesses you all. Now let our guest speak. I believe <PRO_HESHE> addressed you, Sir Laris.~
@2143 = ~Gerrold's talking about the Planar Hunters.~
@2144 = ~It's all right, Gerrold, Tymora loves you. Your unpredictability is beautiful in her eyes.~
@2145 = ~Please! My colleagues! Sir Timmoth! We've been through this how many times now? You're all just different sides of the same coin. Tymora blesses you all. Now let our guest speak. I believe <PRO_HESHE> addressed you, Lady Curell.~
@2146 = ~Please! My colleagues! We've gone through this how many times now? You're all just different sides of the same coin. Tymora blesses you all. Now let our guest speak. I believe <PRO_HESHE> addressed you, Lady Curell.~
@2147 = ~Sir Timmoth, please. There is no call for such harsh words. You will make poor Lady Curell cry again.~
@2148 = ~Sir Timmoth, please. Your harsh words are uncalled for. You will make poor Lady Curell cry.~
@2149 = ~Sir Timmoth, please. You will make poor Lady Curell cry again.~
@2150 = ~Greetings again, <CHARNAME>! Fortune favors the bold. Lady Luck smiles upon you this day!~
@2151 = ~Oh, Tymora help me! Even with our oppressors on the run, you keep on with the "savage" bit?~
@2152 = ~One more thing, <CHARNAME>. I've been saving a special draught for just the right occasion. These potions will restore both mind and spirit. Drink up! This is no time to be weary.~
@2153 = ~<CHARNAME>! I've found you, and not a moment too soon! You're in danger! DANGER, I TELL YOU!~ [OH90429]
/* altering Najim lines to remove Baeloth's Pits references, keeping them vague so it might just be a RANDOM djinni you've never met teleports in and warns you */
@2154 = ~Who are you?~ /* Changed due to the fact that he doesn't know you */
@2155 = ~What a shock. Danger and I always seem to go hand in hand.~
@2156 = ~This doesn't have anything to do with the tavern that burned down last week, does it? Because I wasn't involved.~
/* end of Najim altered lines */
@2157 = ~I was attacked by a group of bounty hunters! Before I escaped, I heard them say your name—I came to warn you!~ [OH90433]
@2158 = ~You're safe now.~
@2159 = ~Let me guess. This "escape" involved your telling them where to find me.~
@2160 = ~Wait! Something is wrong... we're in an ambush! Prepare yourselves! The bounty hunters are upon us!~ [OH90436]
@2161 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>! I suspect the bard's not really a bard!~ [OH90438]
@2162 = ~No... Maybe. But then I thought better of it. I couldn't leave you to face them alone!~ [OH90463]
@2163 = ~<CHARNAME>! They are attempting to capture you, battle your way to freedom or become a captive!~
@2164 = ~That will never happen!~
@2165 = ~Is that what they want? Very well. I'll go with you... for now.~
@2166 = ~Praise the gods, you have saved us both. And from a fate most dire, I am certain. You have my deepest gratitude, <CHARNAME>.~
@2167 = ~Thank you for coming to my aid. Had they caught me unprepared, I wouldn't have stood a chance.~
@2168 = ~That was close. Far too close.~
@2169 = ~Deep enough for you to grant me a wish?~
@2170 = ~I would offer you a wish, but while I was not captured again, neither have I been set free. It is beyond my power.~
@2171 = ~I can perform a small divination, if you'd like. A glimpse into another time, a chance to see what would have happened had we not prevailed this day.~
@2172 = ~Interesting. I AM curious as to the hunters' purpose...~
@2173 = ~Such an insight may prove valuable.~
@2174 = ~No. Let's get out of here before the bartender realizes I just killed half his patrons.~
@2175 = ~I shall cast the spell.~
@2176 = ~As you wish. Then I shall bid you farewell, <CHARNAME>, and good fortune in your travels!~
@2177 = ~It is done. Dormamus will trouble us no longer. It saddens me to confine another genie thus, but he left me no choice.~ [OH92820]
@2178 = ~His companions will notice he's gone. I will take his shape so they believe I am he.~ [OH92821]
@2179 = ~Now, go back downstairs, quickly. You've done much to arouse suspicion already.~ [OH92822]
@2180 = ~Ho ho, and I'm back! They say, "there's no place like home," but I'd rather be where the action is.~ [OH100631]
@2181 = ~As you freed me from the efreet's prison, it appears we are even, mortal. Or should I call you <CHARNAME>?~ [OH100632]
@2182 = ~Call me friend.~
@2183 = ~My name will be sufficient.~
@2184 = ~Call me whatever you like, as far away from me as possible.~
@2185 = ~As you wish—~ [OH100633]
@2186 = ~You will not take me alive!~ [OH90444]
@2187 = ~Heya! Wanna play a game?~
@2188 = ~Yes!~
@2189 = ~Yes.~
@2190 = ~Yes?~
@2191 = ~No. Gods, no.~
@2192 = ~How about now?~
@2193 = ~All right.~
@2194 = ~No. No, no, no. Noooo...~
@2195 = ~Yes. Fine. Let's play a game.~
@2196 = ~Please. No.~
@2197 = ~NO!~
@2198 = ~How about now? Still wanna play a game?~
@2199 = ~I said yes.~
@2200 = ~Still yes.~
@2201 = ~Can you hear me? I said yes.~
@2202 = ~Yes, yes, I get it. Move on.~
@2203 = ~I'm going to kill you if you don't move forward.~
@2204 = ~Great! We're gonna play a really fun game. But you gotta do some roleplaying! What do you wanna play as: a fighter, a wizard, or a thief?~
@2205 = ~I shall take on the role of a fighter.~
@2206 = ~A wizard sounds like fun.~
@2207 = ~I enjoy sneaking around. Let me try being a thief.~
@2208 = ~A fighter's a fine choice for your first game. I'm gonna be the dungeon master, which means I create the story and situations and then you get to play through them! I'll even roll your dice for you. Ready to play? Good, let's go.~
@2209 = ~Ah, a fan of magic. Wizard it is, then. I'm gonna be the dungeon master, which means I create the story and situations and then you get to play through them! I'll even roll your dice for you. Ready to play? Good, let's go.~
@2210 = ~Okay, thief it is! I'm gonna be the dungeon master, which means I create the story and situations and then you get to play through them! I'll even roll your dice for you. Ready to play? Good, let's go.~
@2211 = ~Ooh, a fighter! You like to act tough, do you? I thought I wanted to be a fighter once, but then my mother reminded me I have trouble chopping wood for the winter... and the wood's sitting still! Better I stick to telling stories, I think.~
@2212 = ~Anyway, let me just get my Tome of Adventure here... right, got it. Let's get started.~
@2213 = ~You are a fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN>, a mercenary who makes <PRO_HISHER> living with <PRO_HISHER> sword, and a good living it has been. A paragon of youth, strength, and vitality, you are an impressive sight in your brightly polished armor. So it is no surprise that when you enter the town of Berenford, the children look at you in awe, even as their parents run to shield them from an unknown, yet powerful new presence.~
@2214 = ~It is a day like any other, and you had briefly considered scrounging around Berenford for work, but something in these people's attitudes stops you in your tracks. All is not right here. It is not unusual for people to be scared of the unknown, but this group seems a bit TOO scared. As the adults shuffle their children indoors, you are left facing what might loosely be termed a town square. Looking around, you notice several nondescript buildings, a temple of Lathander, and a blacksmith.~
@2215 = ~Enter the Temple of Lathander.~
@2216 = ~Enter the blacksmith's.~
@2217 = ~The Temple of Lathander is adorned in rich yellow, orange, and red tapestries arranged on the walls such that they mimic the hues and patterns of a rising sun. You at first think the temple to be empty before a small woman meekly pokes her head out of one of the side vestibules. "Sorry," she says timidly, "but I'm afraid the temple is closed. Please try back later."~
@2218 = ~Ask her why the temple is closed.~
@2219 = ~Leave the temple and enter the blacksmith's.~
@2220 = ~Leave the town and head to Mount Redigar.~
@2221 = ~"The priest, Morninglord Aldaron, is not here at the moment, and I am but a lowly acolyte. I have neither the training nor enough of the Morninglord's favor to provide adequate temple services on my own."~
@2222 = ~Inquire as to when Aldaron will return.~
@2223 = ~"He does not approve his schedule with me," she answers curtly as she turns away. Yet something stops her, and she turns back, eyes your glistening armor and the heavy sword sheathed on your belt, and begins again. "I apologize, but the truth is the Morninglord has been gone too long now. He is almost certainly dead."~
@2224 = ~"He left almost three tendays ago to journey to Mount Redigar, but he should have returned long ago. It is at most a three-day journey there and another three back. You can even see the mountain from the town square."~
@2225 = ~"Mount Redigar is the home of Fernault, a warlord that recently moved into the area and began terrorizing the people. Aldaron was certain he could talk sense into the tyrant—confident that Lathander would protect him if the worst came—but he has not returned!"~
@2226 = ~"My mentor—my friend—has been slain by that monster, and now I don't see how the people here will ever be free of him! Please, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, you look to be a great warrior. Rid our town of this tyrant if you can! Oh, I'm sorry, but my emotions overwhelm me. I cannot speak any more of it!" She runs off, leaving you alone in the temple.~
@2227 = ~The blacksmith's shop is a small wooden building with a low roof and a crowded and drafty interior. The wall is lined with examples of his handiwork: swords, spears, and shields, but everything is covered in soot. The smith looks up warily from his anvil as you enter and beckons you forward. "What d'ya want?" he asks gruffly.~
@2228 = ~Ask if he has anything rare for sale.~
@2229 = ~Leave the blacksmith's and enter the temple.~
@2230 = ~He shakes his head. "I have nothing for sale. Not anymore!"~
@2231 = ~Ask why a merchant would have no items for sale.~
@2232 = ~"Because we no longer have any currency! All we used to have went to our new lord, Fernault. 'Taxes,' he called it, but it's more like 'theft' if you ask me! Because he simply takes everything we get, gold has become worthless here, and so I don't want any you may have. The only way I work now is for an exchange of services, and I doubt you'd have anything I want. Although..."~
@2233 = ~Suddenly, there is a commotion at the door, and before you can object, the smith hurries you behind a nearby pile of crates and motions you to be silent. Almost before he can turn back around, a large man bursts into his shop. "Smith!" he bellows. "Your shipment is late. Where are the weapons Fernault has ordered?"~
@2234 = ~"I—I—I need time," the smith stammers in reply. "That many weapons cannot be made in a tenday, particularly when it is so difficult to come by supplies, a situation brought about by your master, I might add!"~
@2235 = ~The large man steps forward and backhands the smith, sending him to the ground. "Watch your tongue, cur! First, Lord Fernault is not just MY master, but OUR master! Second, he will not be blamed for your incompetence! You have two days to finish the order. If you do not have the weapons by then, your daughter will pay the price!"~
@2236 = ~Stay in hiding.~
@2237 = ~Smite the man from behind with your sword.~
@2238 = ~The smith nods his understanding, and the large man barrels his way out the door. When he is gone, the smith motions you forward and out the door. "You've got to go," he says nervously. "I have far too much work to do."~
@2239 = ~Ask him about Lord Fernault.~
@2240 = ~With a mighty swing, you split the man's skull, felling him in one blow. As his body slumps to the floor, the smith looks at you in a disbelief which soon turns to panic. "You've really done it now," he cries. "Lord Fernault's seneschal killed in my shop! Quick, help me get the body into the furnace before anyone finds it!"~
@2241 = ~"No one's ever seen him," the man whispers, "but he and his soldiers came here several tendays ago and immediately set about robbing the people blind. Anything of value—gold, jewels, iron, even food and, as you just saw, weapons—they simply seize without payment."~
@2242 = ~"His fortress lies somewhere in Mount Redigar to the north. That's where they took my daughter several days ago as a means of 'persuading' me to continue working for free. Why do you ask? You aren't really thinking of getting rid of him, are you? Because if you are, I beg you to keep an eye out for Peldea, my daughter. Rescue her if you can!"~
@2243 = ~Agree to rescue his daughter.~
@2244 = ~Tell him that you cannot guarantee you will be able to rescue his daughter.~
@2245 = ~Tell him that you have no intention of going to Lord Fernault's fortress.~
@2246 = ~"Oh, thank you!" he replies with a wide smile. "Since you have promised to return to me the only thing in this world I care about, I shall give you this!" He pulls up a loose plank from the floor, reaches his hand into the hole, and brings forth a rough cloth, which he quickly unwraps to reveal a perfectly smooth blue blade.~
@2247 = ~As your hand grasps the sword's hilt, a series of orange runes pulse along the crossguard, hinting at the power within the blade. "It's called Caelfor, and it was passed to me by my father, a master smith known far and wide as the best these parts have ever known. I reckon there are few better swords in the world than this. May it always strike true for you, and if you could lodge it in Lord Fernault's brain, I would celebrate your name forever."~
@2248 = ~"But we have spoken too long already. I really do need to get back to work, so I wish you luck in your travels. Farewell."~
@2249 = ~"Ah," he replies, obviously disappointed. "I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Suffice it to say, I will be happy for anything you can do."~
@2250 = ~"Ah," he replies, obviously disappointed. "I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. If you do change your mind, the people around here would be mightily relieved if you could end his tyranny."~
@2251 = ~As you turn to the north, heading out of town, a short, balding man approaches you meekly, hat in hand. "Excuse me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>," he begins, "but you look as though you are made of the stuff of heroes. Would you free our town from the clutches of Lord Fernault and his soldiers?"~
@2252 = ~Indicate that you will.~
@2253 = ~Say that you will for the right price.~
@2254 = ~Say that you are too busy at the moment.~
@2255 = ~"Oh, thank you, THANK YOU!" He shakes your hand furiously. "We do not have anything to pay you with right now, for Fernault's greed is so great that he has stripped our land bare of anything of value. However, anyone that can storm his fortress and kill him will undoubtedly find his vaults filled to overflowing with gold. Now good luck to you, and fare thee well!"~
@2256 = ~"We do not have anything to pay you with right now," he answers, "for Fernault's greed is so great that he has stripped our land bare of anything of value. However, anyone that can storm his fortress and kill him will undoubtedly find his vaults filled to overflowing with gold. But if that is not enough, then so be it. Fare thee well!"~
@2257 = ~"That is a shame," he answers, "for Fernault's greed is so great that he has stripped our land bare of anything of value. Therefore, anyone that can storm his fortress and kill him will undoubtedly find his vaults filled to overflowing with gold. But if you are too busy, then so be it. Fare thee well!"~
@2258 = ~"The soldiers were fighting amongst themselves, so they agreed to split up. One group took our wagon and horses and headed west. Another took my mother and brother and headed east." You look on the ground and, sure enough, there are tracks leading both east and west. The soldiers made no attempt to conceal their movement, so both paths would be easy enough to follow.~
@2259 = ~Head west in pursuit of the wagon and horses.~
@2260 = ~Head east in pursuit of the girl's mother and brother.~
@2261 = ~Forget the entire mess and continue north towards Mount Redigar.~
@2262 = ~The path west winds around several low hills and into a lightly forested area. The sun filters down through the canopy, and the birds chirp merrily in the cool breeze. Overall, it is a not unpleasant journey.~
@2263 = ~Attack the orcs.~
@2264 = ~Settle down to wait for a better opportunity.~
@2265 = ~Leave the scene and continue north to Mount Redigar.~
@2266 = ~You draw your blade and charge into the camp while the confused orcs drop their mugs and stumble for their weapons. Not giving them any chance to recover, you bring your sword down with a mighty blow, nearly cleaving the first orc in two, and then turn to face the second. The monster raises its axe and growls at you as it lumbers forward.~
@2267 = ~You deftly sidestep the awkward swing and bring your own sword up in a backward arc directly into the orc's back. The blade cleaves through the monster's thin leather armor, and it grunts loudly as it falls over into the dust. It twitches a couple times on the ground but quickly stills in the blood-soaked mud.~
@2268 = ~You deftly sidestep the awkward swing and bring your own sword up in a backward arc directly towards the orc's back, but you are surprised when the beast, anticipating your move, dives forward into the dirt, causing your own sword to swing harmlessly through the air.~
@2269 = ~Before you can adjust, the orc swipes your legs out from under you, and your blade flies from your grip as you plunge headlong into the dirt. As you roll over, desperately trying to regain your footing, the orc lands on your chest, a dagger now plunging towards your throat. Within seconds, the world goes black.~
@2270 = ~The sudden sound of soft chanting on the breeze makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. Turning around, you notice another orc you had not seen before, this one wearing the robes of a tribal shaman, standing by the wagon waving his hands.~
@2271 = ~Charge him and attack.~
@2272 = ~Throw your sword at him.~
@2273 = ~Run for cover.~
@2274 = ~You quickly cover the ground between the two of you, but not before the shaman finishes his enchantment. You notice a shimmering in the air around his hands that quickly enlarges to encompass you. For a moment, you feel extremely tired, and you find yourself thinking of simply curling up on the ground and going to sleep, but you manage to shake off the effects of the enchantment.~
@2275 = ~With a mighty roar, you raise your sword and bring it down upon the upraised arm of the shaman. Skin and bone give way as you slice clean through the frail body. The orc crumples to the ground and moves no more.~
@2276 = ~You quickly cover the ground between the two of you, but not before the shaman finishes his enchantment. You notice a shimmering in the air around his hands that quickly enlarges to encompass you. Suddenly, you feel extremely tired, and you find yourself thinking how wonderful a nap would feel. Without a care in the world, you curl up into a ball and fade off into a dream from which you never wake.~
@2277 = ~With a shout, you hurl your sword through the air. The weapon arcs wildly and clatters noisily into the wagon, but it is enough to disrupt the shaman's concentration. His spell fizzles with a sharp explosion, and he staggers back, hands already digging into his pouches for another set of reagents. Acting quickly, you give him a swift punch to his jaw that sends him reeling. You regain your sword as he begins weaving another spell.~
@2278 = ~You quickly dodge behind the wagon, but not before the shaman finishes his enchantment. You notice a shimmering in the air around his hands that quickly enlarges to encompass you. For a moment, you feel extremely tired, and you find yourself thinking of simply curling up on the ground and going to sleep, but you manage to shake off the effects of the enchantment. Realizing his spell has failed, you charge around the wagon and straight for him.~
@2279 = ~You quickly dodge behind the wagon, but not before the shaman finishes his enchantment. You notice a shimmering in the air around his hands that quickly enlarges to encompass you. Suddenly, you feel extremely tired, and you find yourself thinking how wonderful a nap would feel. Without a care in the world, you curl up into a ball and fade off into a dream from which you never wake.~
@2280 = ~Searching the wagon reveals little of use to you. The cargo consists mostly of the drained ale kegs, bolts of cloth, beads, and other baubles for making clothes, but one helmet draws your attention. Though it is made of metal and appears well crafted and sturdy, it is very light—too light for normal metal. A set of soft purple runes etched into the crown confirms that the helmet is enchanted in some way.~
@2281 = ~Put the helmet on.~
@2282 = ~Discard the helmet and continue on to Mount Redigar.~
@2283 = ~The helm fits easily onto your head—so easily, in fact, that you swear it must have been forged just for you—but you experience no obvious magical effect. Shrugging, you proceed onwards towards Mount Redigar.~
@2284 = ~You settle down to observe the camp. Hours go by until night at last settles over the scene. Although the two orcs occasionally gaze out into the fields to the south—thereby hinting at the existence of others out foraging for food or supplies—no one else returns to the camp. At last, the ale gets the best of the two, and they settle down by the fire, the sounds of snoring soon filling the air.~
@2285 = ~Sneak up on the orcs and kill them.~
@2286 = ~You sneak up quietly and plunge your sword into the first orc's gut. The beast squeals under the blow but otherwise is unable to react before its life bleeds out. The second orc sits up with a shout, but you bring your blade up in a savage arc directly into its jaw. It too slumps over in a pool of its own blood. The entire fight is finished before it has begun.~
@2287 = ~The path east winds around several low hills and into a lightly forested area. The sun filters down through the canopy, and the birds chirp merrily in the cool breeze. Overall, it is a not unpleasant journey.~
@2288 = ~As the light fades, you come to a break in the trees that harbors a small camp. Within, a single large humanoid figure absently pokes a stick into a fire pit while two frightened humans—a woman and a young boy—sit opposite, wide-eyed with fear.~
@2289 = ~The large humanoid shifts position so that you can clearly see its face, and your initial suspicion is confirmed. It is an ogre, the smallest and weakest of the giant-kin, but nevertheless much larger and stronger than a human. Looking around, you see no other guards for the two prisoners. The ogre sighs and continues poking his stick into the fire disinterestedly.~
@2290 = ~Sneak up behind the ogre and attack him.~
@2291 = ~Wait for a better opportunity.~
@2292 = ~Leave the captives to their fate and continue to Mount Redigar.~
@2293 = ~You tiptoe silently up behind the ogre, but a misstep causes a twig to break loudly under your feet. The ogre snaps to attention and turns quickly around. It snarls at the sight of you and picks up the bone of a large unknown animal lying nearby. Swinging its bone club with a roar, it lumbers towards you.~
@2294 = ~Stand and fight the ogre.~
@2295 = ~Flee and continue to Mount Redigar.~
@2296 = ~The ogre swings its makeshift club wildly at you as you deftly feint to the right and then dodge left. Your move puts the behemoth off balance, and you seize the opportunity to swing your sword into its unprotected right flank. You feel the crack of ribs as your sword bites deep into its side, and the ogre emits a howl of pain and rage.~
@2297 = ~You quickly untie the two prisoners and usher them into the woods, but the female prisoner resists and instead approaches the ogre's burnt body. She rifles through the beast's pouches and pulls forth a small, nondescript silver ring, which she then hands to you. "My husband is dead and so will no longer need this," she says sadly, "but the service you have done me today deserves a reward. When you wear this ring, you will become completely invisible to everyone else."~
@2298 = ~You escort the two former prisoners back to the site of the attack and the young girl still hiding in the grass. The small group again mourns their dead but thanks you for reuniting those that are left. The three depart on foot towards Berenford to the south, and you are left to continue traveling north towards Mount Redigar.~
@2299 = ~The ogre swings its makeshift club as you feint to the right and then attempt to dodge back left, but the cagey beast deftly reverses its swing to catch you right in the gut. You stagger backwards as the air knocked out of you, but the ogre closes quickly, its bone club already raised for another blow. You raise your sword desperately to parry, but the next swing forces you to the ground and knocks the blade from your hand. You look up in time to see the third blow raining down. It is the last sight you ever see.~
@2300 = ~You hunch down into the tall grass to observe the ogre and wait for a better opportunity. Every so often, the beast stops poking the fire long enough to look around—thereby hinting at the existence of others out foraging for food or supplies—but none ever return. At last, long after night has settled over the camp, the ogre slumps down and closes its eyes. A few minutes later, you hear the unmistakable sound of snoring.~
@2301 = ~Sneak up on the beast and kill it.~
@2302 = ~Sneak around to the prisoners and free them.~
@2303 = ~You tiptoe silently up to the ogre, but a misstep causes a twig to snap loudly under your feet. The monster's eyes fly open as it jumps to attention and turns around. It snarls at the sight of you, leaps up with surprising agility, and picks up the bone of a large unknown animal lying nearby. Swinging its bone club with a roar, it lumbers towards you.~
@2304 = ~Silently, you make your way to the two prisoners on the opposite side of the fire. They awaken as you approach, but you motion for them to be quiet as you slice through their bonds with your sword. Within moments, they are free.~
@2305 = ~The path north is uneventful, and a quick encampment allows you to get a few hours' rest before continuing north in the early morning. Before long, you come upon a single traveler going in the opposite direction. He leans heavily on a walking stick, and his gray beard blends perfectly into his flowing robes. "Excuse me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>," he beckons to you, "You look to be a warrior of some skill. Would you, by chance, be traveling to see Lord Fernault at Mount Redigar?"~
@2306 = ~Tell him you are going to rid the region of Lord Fernault.~
@2307 = ~Tell him you are going to try to join Lord Fernault's army.~
@2308 = ~Deny that you are going to Mount Redigar.~
@2309 = ~Ignore him and continue north to Mount Redigar.~
@2310 = ~"Ah, I was right. You look just the type, and so I have a gift for you." From his pack, he takes a ragged gray cloak that looks to have been singed in a fire and hands it to you.~
@2311 = ~Thank him and put the cloak on.~
@2312 = ~Ask him why you would want an old cloak.~
@2313 = ~Refuse the gift.~
@2314 = ~"Ah, it seems I was wrong about you," he shrugs. "Sorry to bother you then." He whistles a light tune as he continues south, and you are left alone on the road north.~
@2315 = ~The cloak is light, but amazingly sturdy given its decrepit appearance. You feel a slight warmth as you pull it around you, but it is otherwise unremarkable. The man smiles at you. "Keep that cloak with you when you meet Lord Fernault. You will need it," he says as he continues south. All other questions are met only with a shake of his head as he fades into the distance. You turn back to the road north.~
@2316 = ~"This cloak is certainly old," he begins, "but age is not always a reason to discard something. I know well that great power often comes with great age. I can guarantee you that Lord Fernault thinks the same way."~
@2317 = ~You travel north another day and spend another fitful night beneath the stars before at last reaching Redigar in the morning. The lonely mountain dominates the sky, and you can see a curl of smoke issuing forth from the summit. It doesn't take long for you to locate a cave entrance that is remarkably unguarded. You venture within.~
@2318 = ~The torchlit passage slopes downwards for some way before evening out, and a breeze—warm, dry, and stifling—washes over you and causes the torchlight to dance playfully on the walls. From far away, you hear a strange, guttural barking in a tongue you do not understand, but you soon realize that it is, in fact, singing. The voice is rough, deep, and completely inhuman.~
@2319 = ~The singing grows louder as you approach a doorway. Peeking around the edge, you see a crude kitchen with scattered tables holding a plethora of haphazard spices, foodstuffs, and cooking implements. A large fire pit dominates the center of the room, over which hangs a heavy boiling cauldron supported by an iron rod set between two massive oaken beams. A troll, humming a tuneless melody, uses a human femur to stir the contents.~
@2320 = ~The passage leads onward past the doorway and further into the mountain. You also see a second passage out of the kitchen directly across from your position, although the troll lies between you and it.~
@2321 = ~Continue further along the same passage.~
@2322 = ~Attack the troll.~
@2323 = ~Try to sneak past the troll to the second passage.~
@2324 = ~Put on your ring of invisibility and walk past the troll to the second passage.~
@2325 = ~You are upon the troll in a flash. Surprised, the monster turns and raises its arm in defense as your blade cleaves cleanly through the limb and bites deep into its chest. It staggers backward, howling terribly, and steadies itself against one of the great oaken beams.~
@2326 = ~You move to continue the assault when you feel something grab your ankle. Looking down, you notice the arm you severed appears to have a life of its own, as it grabs at your feet and tries to trip you. You look up to see the troll smiling macabrely at you. As you watch, a new arm sprouts from the stump, and the massive wound you carved into its chest closes and heals. Within moments, the monster is whole again.~
@2327 = ~Continue the attack with your sword.~
@2328 = ~Try to shake the severed arm off your foot.~
@2329 = ~Run away.~
@2330 = ~The severed arm impedes you, but you fight through your reduced mobility, again bringing your sword down through an upstretched arm. This time, however, you press your advantage by reversing your swing and bringing your blade back up and clean through the creature's neck. Its head falls off its shoulders and rolls to a stop a few yards away as the body slumps to the ground.~
@2331 = ~Hack the troll's head off with your sword again.~
@2332 = ~You raise your sword again for another strike, but before you can bring the blade down, the troll reaches up with its taloned hand, grabs you by the neck, and lifts you clean off the ground. You frantically stab at it as it hisses at you malevolently and slowly crushes your windpipe. Within moments, the world goes black as you fade into oblivion.~
@2333 = ~You use your sword as a lever to pry the fingers from around your ankles and then shake your foot furiously to kick the severed arm away. The limb bounces on the floor a couple times before landing in the cooking fire with a loud pop. Suddenly, the troll emits the first true howl of pain you've heard from it, and the arm twitches in the flame for a brief time before finally shriveling to a black crisp and dissolving to ash.~
@2334 = ~Continue to attack the troll with your sword.~
@2335 = ~Try to push the whole beast into the fire pit.~
@2336 = ~Grab a torch from a wall sconce and use the makeshift club to attack the troll.~
@2337 = ~Flee Mount Redigar and abandon the quest.~
@2338 = ~You charge into the massive troll with your shoulder, attempting to muscle it into the fire. The beast instantly realizes your intent and grabs you by the waist with its muscular arm, attempting to lift you whole off the ground. You deftly wriggle out of its grasp, dive low, and grab its leg. Desperately, it claws at your back, but your mail performs its job perfectly, and you use your superior position to force the monster off balance and back into the cooking pit.~
@2339 = ~The troll emits a howl that chills you to the bone, and its thrashing sends sparks and embers flying across the room. But its fate is sealed. Within seconds, the once-massive troll is little more than a pile of ash. You take a moment to collect both your bearings and your dropped gear and then proceed out the door opposite from where you entered.~
@2340 = ~You charge into the massive troll with your shoulder, attempting to muscle it into the pit. The beast instantly realizes your intent and grabs you by the waist with its muscular arm, attempting to lift you whole off the ground. You try to wriggle out of its grasp, but it proves surprisingly nimble. It picks you up and hurls you to the floor, knocking the wind out of you. Quickly, it closes the gap, its taloned hands clawing at your neck. It is the last sight you see in life.~
@2341 = ~Seeing the flaming club in your hand, the troll loses courage and begins to slowly give way, its arms raised in front of its face in defense. You lunge forward, thrusting the torch like a sword under the defending limbs to score a direct hit on the beast's chest. It howls in pain and, realizing it has nowhere to run, finally moves to the attack, but you bring the club up in a backhanded swing and connect with its jaw.~
@2342 = ~You decisively press your advantage, and the troll again cedes ground, only this time it trips on one of the many piles of debris and plunges to the floor. You move quickly on the beast, hitting it repeatedly with the flame as it howls in pain and tries to crawl away. Within moments, it is still, and you use the torch to light the entire body on fire. Soon, the once-massive troll is little more than a pile of ash. You take a moment to collect both your bearings and your dropped gear and then proceed out the door opposite from where you entered.~
@2343 = ~Seeing the flaming club in your hand, the troll loses courage and begins to slowly give way, its arms raised in front of its face in defense. You lunge forward, thrusting the club like a sword under the defending limbs to score a direct hit on the beast's chest. It howls in pain and, realizing it now has nothing to lose, finally moves to the attack. You bring the club up in a backhanded swing towards its face, but it catches the end of the flaming club in one of its massive hands.~
@2344 = ~You feel the bone in the hand give way and smell the putrid scent of burning flesh, but you have no way of blocking the troll's other massive talon that connects cleanly with your jaw. The club flies from your hand as you stagger backwards, dazed. The monster loses no time in closing the gap, and its claws quickly close around your throat. Within moments, you have lost consciousness, never to wake again.~
@2345 = ~Really? You run away? What kind of adventure is that, you coward? Time to reconsider.~
@2346 = ~Fine then! Since that makes our game no fun, I think I'll exercise my dungeon master's prerogative and just say that as you're running away, a rabid goat jumps out of the woods and gores you to death. Now you're dead, so hah!~
@2347 = ~You turn to flee, but trip over the limb still attached to your ankle. You scramble to get back up, but the troll loses no time in closing the gap, and its claws quickly close around your throat. Within moments, you have lost consciousness, never to wake again.~
@2348 = ~You wait for the troll to turn its back to you and then use the gloom of the firelit chamber to sneak to the other side. Yet when you are only halfway across, the troll raises its nose, sniffs the air, and then turns in delight. "You have returned!" it cackles. "Did you bring anything for the stew?"~
@2349 = ~Answer that you did not.~
@2350 = ~Give it a portion of your rations.~
@2351 = ~It looks at you with a mixture of disappointment and irritation. "You know how much I like different creatures for the stew! Is it too much to ask that when you go on patrol, you at least bring me a little something too? I can't believe how incompetent you lot are! Now begone, and be glad Lord Fernault has forbidden me to put his guards in my stew!"~
@2352 = ~Move on to the passage opposite the one you entered.~
@2353 = ~It gives something surprisingly close to a squeal of delight. "Oh, thank you! You know how much I like different creatures for the stew! I'm envious that you guards get to go on patrol, but at least you're good enough to bring me a little something when you do!" It plops the food into the stew and begins again humming its tuneless melody.~
@2354 = ~You wait for the troll to turn its back to you and then use the gloom of the firelit chamber to sneak to the other side. Yet when you are only halfway across, the troll raises its nose, sniffs the air, and then turns in delight. "I thought I smelled dessert!" it cackles. Realizing your gambit has failed and you are now too exposed to turn back, you are forced to attack.~
@2355 = ~You slip the ring on and quietly make your way through the chamber. When you are only halfway across, the troll raises its nose, sniffs the air, and then turns in delight. "I thought I smelled dessert!" it cackles, before its face turns to one of confusion. "Huh? Where are you?" it asks quizzically. It creeps past you to the tables behind you and begins searching through potential hiding spots. You realize you have the opportunity to escape, and you hurriedly move through the kitchen to the passage opposite.~
@2356 = ~The passage descends a bit further, and before long you hear the sound of rough laughter. You slowly approach a doorway at the end of the hallway to see several human guards playing cards and drinking profusely. They joke raucously as they throw bits of meat or slugs of ale at each other and generally act like drunken degenerates. You see another exit further into the mountain directly across the room from you.~
@2357 = ~Return back up the passage to the troll.~
@2358 = ~Attack the guards.~
@2359 = ~Enter the room authoritatively and bluff your way past the guards.~
@2360 = ~Put on your ring of invisibility and sneak past the guards.~
@2361 = ~You turn and head back up the tunnel to your previous location. Soon, the sound of guttural singing has once more replaced that of raucous laughter.~
@2362 = ~You draw your sword and pounce on the first guard with a single motion, cleaving deep into his chest and felling him before he can react. A second guard growls ferally at you and brings her mace around savagely. You easily parry her drunken swing, thrust your sword up under her ribcage, and then shove her gasping body backwards in a collapsing heap.~
@2363 = ~The third and fourth guards are upon you before she hits the ground, but you deftly position your body so that one has no room to get a full swing even as you parry the attack of the other and counter with a fierce blow to the neck. As he drops, you pivot, bringing your sword around in a powerful arc that sweeps through the feeble attempt to parry and cleaves deep into the fourth guard's side. He too stumbles backwards in a heap.~
@2364 = ~The third and fourth guards are upon you before she hits the ground, but you deftly position your body so that one has no room to get a full swing even as you parry the attack of the other and counter with a fierce blow to the neck. As he drops, you pivot, bringing your sword around in a powerful arc...~
@2365 = ~That sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I don't think that I'm interested.~
@2366 = ~With the guards defeated, you take a moment to catch your breath when a large figure steps out of the deep shadows of the torchlit room. The golden trim on his armor marks him as a soldier of some rank. "Congratulations," the gravelly baritone chides, "you managed to dispatch four drunkards." He slides his massive sword from its sheath and grips the handle easily in both hands. "Let's see if you can defeat a sober warrior, eh?"~
@2367 = ~Attack the new warrior.~
@2368 = ~The man leaps at you, bringing his large blade around in a surprisingly tight arc. You parry the blow, but the force sends you staggering back, your hands ringing with the power of the collision. Yet you have no time to recover, for the man bears down again on you with a series of three rapid swings that you barely manage to avoid. You give ground and kick one of the overturned chairs into his path, a desperate gambit that gives you a scant amount of breathing room.~
@2369 = ~Your opponent brings his sword down violently on the chair, smashing it easily to splinters, and disdainfully kicks the debris away. With surprisingly quick reflexes for a man wearing such heavy armor, he charges you, closing the distance in less than a second.~
@2370 = ~Reflexively, you move to step back, but then instead dive forward, sweeping his feet from under him. The man falls in stunned disbelief at your unorthodox tactic, his sword clattering on the cave floor. In a flash, you regain your feet and swing your blade backhanded directly into his face guard, splitting his helmet and then his skull. He collapses with a thud. You give a brief look around the room at the now five corpses and proceed into the tunnel opposite the one you entered.~
@2371 = ~Reflexively, you move to step back, desperately parrying the next rapid succession of blows. You marvel at the speed of the man's blade, given the size of his sword and the weight of his mail, and you know your chances to seize victory will be few. You step forward, hoping to come well within the killing arc of his sword and sweep your own blade upwards in a powerful arc of your own...~
@2372 = ~As you step confidently into the room, the guards struggle to stand up, each giving a drunken approximation of either a bow or a salute. "Itsh about time you gotsh here!" one says. "How long doesh a patrol take?"~
@2373 = ~A second chimes in, "Yeah, you know ol' Lord Funrault—hehe, I mean Fernault—wantsh hish gold, and he wantsh it when he wantsh it! Sho you besht getsh goin', and I hopesh you gotsh a lot out of all thosh peasants! Hehe!"~
@2374 = ~A second chimes in, "Yeah, you know ol' Lord Fernault wantsh hish gold, and he wantsh it when he wantsh it! Sho you besht getsh goin'— Hey, wait a minute. Didn't the patrol get back an hour ago?" The group nods, and the drunkard points at you. "Then who'sh <PRO_HESHE>?" The soldiers quickly draw their weapons, and you are forced to fight.~
@2375 = ~You slip the ring on, step boldly into the room, and head to the opposite exit. The guards are so engrossed in their cards and food fight that they don't even hear your footsteps. Soon, you have put the group behind you and are heading further into the mountain.~
@2376 = ~Nope. I'm done. I'm going to run away.~
@2377 = ~A short distance later, the passage widens into a room roughly thirty feet square with a recess in the far wall that is covered by heavy iron bars surrounding a crude, locked oaken door. At first, you see only darkness when you peer into the gloom behind the bars, but then the shadows shift and two figures emerge: a middle-aged man with piercing blue eyes and a wild, unkempt beard and a pretty young girl in her teens.~
@2378 = ~The man eyes you warily. "You don't look familiar," he states hesitantly. "Are you with our captors?"~
@2379 = ~Answer that you are not.~
@2380 = ~Answer that you are.~
@2381 = ~Ask who they are.~
@2382 = ~He sighs, "I am Aldaron and this is Peldea, both of the village of Berenford. Peldea is a hostage kept here to ensure her father, a blacksmith, works adequately to supply Lord Fernault's troops with weapons. I came here some days ago hoping to talk the lord into leaving the region, and if he would not see reason, I was prepared to kill him. I am a priest of Lathander, you see, and I thought the Morninglord would protect me, but I was not prepared for what I found here."~
@2383 = ~"I convinced the guards to let me meet Lord Fernault. They laughed, but in the end, they agreed. But when I was led into his chamber, I saw very little of Fernault. It was a huge cavern, and he spoke from the shadows. I pleaded with him to leave, but he gave my request no regard. After a few minutes, he tired of the conversation, and that's when he made his move."~
@2384 = ~"The shadow itself surrounded me. I could barely take it in before I was knocked unconscious. The next thing I knew, I awoke in this cell, and I've been a prisoner ever since. I never got a good look at Lord Fernault, but this I know. He is most definitely not human, nor is he an elf or dwarf or anything else you might expect."~
@2385 = ~"Now, I would beg you to free us, but the key is in Fernault's chamber, and I fear you will have no better luck than I did. However, if you can recover the keys and free me, I shall help you do battle with Lord Fernault if you so choose." You bid the pair farewell and continue on further into the mountain.~
@2386 = ~"A shame." The man shrugs as both prisoners return to the gloom of the cell.~
@2387 = ~Admit that you lied and really aren't with their captors.~
@2388 = ~Continue on deeper into the mountain.~
@2389 = ~The passage into the mountain now takes a deep plunge, and the air becomes stifling as the little breeze that once existed stills. After some time, the tunnel gives way to a large cavern dotted by torches that fail to completely illuminate the gloom. A crude throne sits upon a stone dais hewn into the far end, and the cavern is littered with large piles of coins and jewels.~
@2390 = ~Enter the cavern cautiously.~
@2391 = ~Enter the cavern boldly.~
@2392 = ~Put on your ring of invisibility and sneak into the cavern.~
@2393 = ~You slip into the chamber, keeping your back to the wall, and carefully edge your way around the cavern. The air is now so hot that sweat pours down your face, and you hear nothing except the popping of the flickering torches. Suddenly, a voice rings out in the gloom.~
@2394 = ~You stride confidently into the chamber, coolly surveying the cavern for any signs of movement. The air is now so hot that sweat pours down your face, and you hear nothing except the popping of the flickering torches. Suddenly, a voice rings out in the gloom.~
@2395 = ~You slip on your ring of invisibility and enter the chamber, coolly surveying the cavern for any signs of movement. The air is now so hot that sweat pours down your face, and you hear nothing except the popping of the flickering torches. Suddenly, a voice rings out. "Do you really think such petty magics will fool me? Your attempt at deception would be laughable were it not so insulting!"~
@2396 = ~"I see you, puny one," slithers the mellifluous tenor. The voice echoes around the cavern, but you are unable to see any living being through the gloom. "I am curious as to why you have entered the domain of Fernault the Ravager. That you have done so proves you are either very brave... or very stupid."~
@2397 = ~Ask that Fernault leave the people here in peace.~
@2398 = ~Demand that Fernault leave the people here in peace.~
@2399 = ~Ask that Fernault free his two prisoners.~
@2400 = ~Demand that Fernault free his two prisoners.~
@2401 = ~State that you are a treasure hunter and are here for the gold and jewels.~
@2402 = ~The voice laughs hollowly. "And what possible reason would I have to do that when everything here is proceeding exactly as I desire it?"~
@2403 = ~The voice sneers, "You are in no position to make demands of me, maggot! It is MY word that is law here, not yours!"~
@2404 = ~Threaten the voice with death if it does not give in to your demands.~
@2405 = ~Offer gold if the voice will give in to your demands.~
@2406 = ~The voice sneers, "Then the explanation is that you are stupid and not brave. To make such an admission shows that you value your life very little."~
@2407 = ~"Death? YOU think to cause MY death? So very foolish. But at least you are right in sensing that this conversation is bound to lead nowhere but violence."~
@2408 = ~"I smell gold as easily as you insignificant worms smell a roast on a flame, and you do not have enough gold to buy any favor from me, no matter how insignificant. And even if you did, I would simply kill you and take it. Now I have lost interest in you, but I will allow you to go in peace if you leave at once."~
@2409 = ~Leave Mount Redigar and abandon the quest.~
@2410 = ~Really? You abandon the quest? What kind of adventure is that, you coward? Time to reconsider.~
@2411 = ~The very shadows begin to shift and coalesce into a frightening figure—tall, muscular, and bulky—that stands up, filling the cavern. Two expansive wings explode outwards and a pair of massive paws bearing a bevy of two-foot-long talons scrape down upon the floor a few feet in front of you. The entire figure is coated in thick scales, a seemingly impenetrable armor dark maroon in color.~
@2412 = ~Two yellow orbs fly open above you and are soon joined by hissing fangs and smoking nostrils. "You wanted Fernault the Ravager?" the beast asks in the same lilting tenor that seems strangely light considering its girth. "Well, now you've got Fernault the Ravager!"~
@2413 = ~The sight of the massive dragon is overwhelming, and you feel the slightest hint of fear in the pit of your stomach, but you are soon awash in a calm that seems almost supernatural. That you can look such a beast in the face with no emotion is curious, but you have little time to think on it further as you draw your sword and face it.~
@2414 = ~The sight of the massive dragon is overwhelming, and fear begins to well up in you uncontrollably. You turn to flee, but the moment you sever your gaze from the creature, the fear dissipates to a controllable level. You have little time to think on it further as you draw your sword and turn to face the creature.~
@2415 = ~The sight of the massive dragon is overwhelming, and fear wells up in you uncontrollably. You flee from the chamber, all thoughts other than escape of no concern. You vaguely hear the dragon laughing and jeering you as you flee, but any consideration of pride is far from your mind.~
@2416 = ~After an indeterminate time, a sense of calm overcomes you, and you look around to find yourself in the prison room where you met the middle-aged man and the young girl. The man sees your confusion. "Dragon fear," he states matter-of-factly. "Nothing you can do, but I was able to calm you through the divine powers Lathander grants me. You should now be able to face Fernault without any further fear... at least of the supernatural variety."~
@2417 = ~Return to the cavern.~
@2418 = ~You thank the priest and return to the cavern. The dragon immediately spies you and eyes you curiously, one eye cocked. "How is it that you return so soon? Ah," it sniggers, "the Lathanderite. I knew I should have killed him, but by restoring your courage, at least he has granted me the pleasure of rending you apart!"~
@2419 = ~Return to the cavern and face the dragon.~
@2420 = ~The fanged jaws open and begin to inhale air in such volume that you fear you might be sucked up into them. Looking deep into the beast's throat, you see the air intake is acting as a bellows within the creature's gut. The great furnace within is even now building a large flame that erupts into the creature's throat, and you realize with dread that the air that is getting sucked in must also eventually be blown out. You dive back into the narrow passage, hoping the walls will protect you from the inferno about to be unleashed.~
@2421 = ~The flames envelop you completely, and you know you must be burned alive, yet you remain amazingly unaffected. In fact, you view the flames around you curiously—almost academically—as they curl around you, hungrily licking your hands, face, and body while doing absolutely no harm to you. Eventually, the flames relent, and you turn around in the soot-blackened tunnel.~
@2422 = ~You slam yourself to the ground and roll into a depression that shields you as the flames roar by overhead. The oxygen is burned away, starving your lungs and suffocating you as you feel the hair on your neck and head singeing. You gasp for air and endure the overwhelming burning on your back for what seems like an eternity, but eventually the flames relent, and you roll over gasping in the soot-blackened tunnel.~
@2423 = ~You slam yourself to the ground hoping to find any cover that might shield you from the flames, but it is too late. The oxygen is burned away, starving your lungs and suffocating you as your body is engulfed in the searing heat. It doesn't take long for you to lose consciousness, never to awaken again.~
@2424 = ~You see a large reptilian eye peering up the tunnel at you. "Ahh..." the dragon exclaims as the eye widens in understanding. "The cloak you wear is enchanted with flame resistance. Very clever, mortal, but my talons and fangs are still more than enough. Come back out here and face me!"~
@2425 = ~You see a large reptilian eye peering up the tunnel at you. "Incredible that you survived that, mortal," the dragon exclaims as the eye widens in amazement, "but my talons and fangs are still more than enough. Come back out here and face me!"~
@2426 = ~You return to the cavern, sword in hand, to find the dragon eying you with what might be described—remotely—as respect. "No fear, no flames," it mutters. "Looks like we'll have to do this the old-fashioned way!" Without any further warning, it swipes a massive talon towards you!~
@2427 = ~You dodge the massive paw with an acrobatic roll and come up, sword swinging. You connect, severing one of the dragon's talons. The beast howls in rage and pushes upwards, wings outstretched into the gloom, but a telltale thud followed by collapsing rock reveals that the monster's mobility is severely restricted in what for it is a small space.~
@2428 = ~The claws slam into you, knocking you forcefully to the ground, but you are able to position your body such that the subsequent rolling launches you back on your feet, sword still in hand. The beast howls in triumph and swipes at you again.~
@2429 = ~Try to dodge and parry the claws again.~
@2430 = ~Take cover in the hallway.~
@2431 = ~Run towards the stone dais to gain some height.~
@2432 = ~You step back into the hallway as the claw scratches and pushes its way into the opening, grasping for you. You swing your sword at the paw and connect, severing one of the dragon's talons. The beast howls in rage as it withdraws its battered hand and pushes upwards, wings outstretched into the gloom, but a telltale thud followed by collapsing rock reveals that the monster's mobility is severely restricted in what for it is a small space. Frustrated, it lunges at the opening again, ripping away the earth with its claws until you are once more exposed.~
@2433 = ~You attempt to withdraw into the hallway, but the monster is too quick. It grabs you and flings you easily to the ground like a rag doll. Your instincts kick in, and you are able to regain your feet quickly, sword still in hand. The beast howls in triumph and swipes at you again.~
@2434 = ~You gain the first few steps just as the monster rounds on you. You dodge the massive paw with an acrobatic roll and come up, sword swinging. You connect, severing one of the dragon's talons. The beast howls in rage and pushes upwards, wings outstretched into the gloom, but a telltale thud followed by collapsing rock reveals that the monster's mobility is severely restricted in what for it is a small space.~
@2435 = ~You sprint for the dais, but the monster is too quick. It grabs you and flings you easily to the ground like a rag doll. Your instincts kick in, and you are able to regain your feet quickly, sword still in hand. The beast howls in triumph and swipes at you again.~
@2436 = ~The claws slam into you, and you fly into the cavern wall with a thud. Bones crunch audibly and pain washes over every inch of you. You struggle to move again, but your battered body no longer responds properly. The beast howls in triumph and lunges at you again. Unable to move, you are quickly overwhelmed. The world fades to black, the sight of gnashing fangs the last you see.~
@2437 = ~Frustrated by his inability to maneuver, Fernault launches at you, this time with fangs bared!~
@2438 = ~Meet its fangs with your sword head-on.~
@2439 = ~Retreat further up the dais.~
@2440 = ~As the fangs reach for you, you drop to the floor, roll under the jaw, and thrust upwards with your sword, piercing through the scales and burying your blade to the hilt. Fernault howls and rears backwards, pulling you up to a standing position as you wrench the blade free from its bleeding jaw. The dragon emits a mighty roar that again shakes debris loose from the ceiling.~
@2441 = ~As the maw hungrily reaches for you, you swing your sword head-on, parrying the razor-sharp fang, but the force of the dragon's lunge pushes you backwards against the cavern wall, knocking the breath from your body. You gasp for air as the creature howls in glee. Sensing your imminent demise, it again lunges at you, fangs bared.~
@2442 = ~You retreat further into the hallway as the fangs reach for you, the muzzle shoveling away ever greater portions of the tunnel. You drop to the floor, roll under the jaw, and thrust upwards with your sword, piercing through the scales and burying your blade to the hilt. Fernault howls and rears backwards, pulling you clean out of the hallway and back up to a standing position, allowing you to wrench the blade free from its bleeding jaw. The dragon emits a mighty roar that again shakes debris loose from the ceiling.~
@2443 = ~As the maw hungrily reaches for you, you give ground and slip into the tunnel again as the razor-sharp fangs slice harmlessly in front of you. The dragon snorts, knocking you to the ground and then again ruthlessly claws away yet more of the hallway until you are once more exposed. You regain your feet as the creature howls in glee. Sensing your imminent demise, it again lunges at you, fangs bared.~
@2444 = ~Then you don't have this kind of clothing. Get back to me when your fortunes change.~
@2445 = ~Hey there, friend. How're you doing?~
@2446 = ~You climb the first several steps by the time Fernault has properly rounded on you. As his maw again comes in for the kill, you drop to the floor and allow yourself to slide back down the steps until you are positioned under the jaw. You thrust upwards with your sword, piercing through the scales and burying your blade to the hilt. Fernault howls and rears backwards, pulling you up to a standing position as you wrench the blade free from its bleeding jaw. The dragon emits a mighty roar that again shakes debris loose from the ceiling.~
@2447 = ~You make a run for the dais but are too slow. The dragon cuts you off, and you desperately parry the razor-sharp fang that pass inches from your face, but the force of the dragon's lunge pushes you backwards against the cavern wall, knocking the breath from your body. You gasp for air as the creature howls in glee. Sensing your imminent demise, it again lunges at you, fangs bared.~
@2448 = ~As the fangs reach for you, you drop to the floor and allow yourself to slide down the steps until you are positioned under the jaw. You thrust upwards with your sword, piercing through the scales and burying your blade to the hilt. Fernault howls and rears backwards, pulling you up to a standing position as you wrench the blade free from its bleeding jaw. The dragon emits a mighty roar that again shakes debris loose from the ceiling.~
@2449 = ~As the maw hungrily reaches for you, you swing your sword head-on, parrying the razor-sharp fang, but the force of the dragon's lunge pushes you backwards into the stone steps, knocking the breath from your body. You gasp for air as the creature howls in glee. Sensing your imminent demise, it again lunges at you, fangs bared.~
@2450 = ~You climb almost to the top by the time Fernault has closed the gap between you. As his maw again comes in for the kill, you drop to the floor and allow yourself to slide back down the steps until you are positioned under the jaw. You thrust upwards with your sword, piercing through the scales and burying your blade to the hilt. Fernault howls and rears backwards, pulling you up to a standing position as you wrench the blade free from its bleeding jaw. The dragon emits a mighty roar that again shakes debris loose from the ceiling.~
@2451 = ~You give ground, trying to gain still more height, but are too slow. The dragon cuts you off, and you desperately parry the razor-sharp fang that pass inches from your face, but the force of the dragon's lunge pushes you backwards into the stone steps, knocking the breath from your body. You gasp for air as the creature howls in glee. Sensing your imminent demise, it again lunges at you, fangs bared.~
@2452 = ~You try to roll backwards acrobatically, but you are too slow. The creature's maw closes over you. Bones crunch audibly and pain washes over your body. Unable to move, you quickly succumb to death. The world fades to black, the sight of gnashing fangs the last you see.~
@2453 = ~The creature roars at you, blood trickling from its jaw. "Perhaps you are not so weak as I once imagined," it concedes warily, "but you are still little more than a worm compared to my draconic majesty! It is now time to end this!" Fernault again lunges, this time bringing both of his claws and his mouth to bear.~
@2454 = ~You realize you cannot dodge or parry all three attacks at once, but you DO see an opportunity. With Fernault intently staring at you and his face lunging in for the kill, you see as in slow-motion his eyes are opened wide and growing ever larger in your view. A well-placed strike would pierce his brain and kill him. With no other options, you hurl your sword haft over blade like a giant knife right at the creature's eye...~
@2455 = ~...Your blade sails true! Fernault rears back, roaring furiously as he claws at his empty eye socket. He thrashes around the room, careening wildly into the walls and roof, sending an ever larger cascade of rocks from above. You realize that it is only a matter of time before Mount Redigar collapses in on itself, and you flee back down the hallway you came from.~
@2456 = ~...Fernault diverts one of his massive paws to swipe the blade from the air, sending it clattering harmlessly against the wall. "What a useless gesture!" he grunts dismissively as you roll under his other paw and retrieve your weapon. The dragon again rounds on you, coming in for the kill, but it seems the gods have given you another chance at victory. You again hurl your sword haft over blade towards the dragon's eye...~
@2457 = ~As you pass the prison cells, you see that the collapsing mountain has bent the bars such that the door has torn open. The man is ushering the young girl onwards, and the three of you flee up the ramp towards the sunlight beyond, the corridor collapsing perilously close to your heels as you run. At last, you burst into the open air amidst a cloud of dust and the deafening roar of a rockslide.~
@2458 = ~You keep running until you are well away from the mountain. At last, you turn to see only a pile of rubble where once Mount Redigar stood. You know that Fernault is dead, for not even a dragon can survive a mountain collapsing on top of it, and without Fernault, his forces will scatter to the four winds.~
@2459 = ~You are a hero upon your return to Berenford, and you are forever known as the slayer of Fernault the Ravager. The people love you and elect you mayor and high defender, both posts you are sure you could keep for life, if you so desire.~
@2460 = ~The villagers send multiple expeditions to the ruined mountain, and over time they collect a large amount of coins and jewels, much of which they willingly give to you. They even find your sword, still buried to the hilt in the dragon's decaying skull, and the weapon's fame lives on long after even you have turned to dust.~
@2461 = ~And so our story comes to an end. You have everything you could want: fame, wealth, and power. What you do with them is a story for another time.~
@2462 = ~...Your aim proves faulty as the sword sails cleanly over the dragon's head and clatters noisily in the darkness beyond. But it matters not for you anymore, as the dragon's claws forcefully knock you to the ground. Helpless to move, the sight of gnashing fangs is the last one you see in this life.~
@2463 = ~Ooh, a wizard! I always wanted to be a wizard too, even got hold of a magic wand once, but I had to give it back after I turned the local priest's head into a rabbit. Not a rabbit head, mind you, a whole rabbit. Going to the temple was never quite the same after that.~
@2464 = ~Anyway, let me just get my Tome of Adventure here... okay, got it. Let's get started.~
@2465 = ~It is a dark and stormy newt, and you have just... wait. Night. It was a dark and stormy night. Sorry about that. Spilled some tea on the page there. Let's start again.~
@2466 = ~It is a dark and stormy night, and you have just arrived at the place you are to meet your mentor. The Wagon's End is a tavern bright and warm, a beacon of refuge in the unseasonably cold gale that has borne down upon the small country village. You make your way through the deep mud of the road and pound heavily on the barred door.~
@2467 = ~A small window cut in the door slides open and a critical eye examines you face. After a moment, the window slides shut and the door is opened. A hunched man pulls you in quickly and then closes and bars the door just as rapidly.~
@2468 = ~He addresses you. "What in the name of all the Hells has possessed you to walk the roads of Marynford at this late hour? Do you care nothing for your life? Well, you are safe indoors now, and I recommend you stay that way until the next day's dawning."~
@2469 = ~After his scolding, the man shuffles back behind the bar and disappears through a door, muttering to himself about "the young people of today." You look around the room and are disturbed and surprised to note that your mentor is nowhere to be seen. There is one patron eating at the bar.~
@2470 = ~Talk to the patron at the bar.~
@2471 = ~Follow the old man through the door behind the bar.~
@2472 = ~Go outside and look for your mentor around the back of the inn.~
@2473 = ~Request a room for the evening and go to sleep.~
@2474 = ~As you reenter the tavern, the barman affixes you with a cold, one-eyed stare. "Well, ye in or out?" ~
@2475 = ~As you sit down, the patron fixes his one good eye upon you, the other an opaque milky orb. "Bad place for travelin' at night. Ain't ye never heard of the curse? Ain't ye never heard of the tales? 'Tis only a fool's luck that ye even made it to the Wagon's End. By all rights, ye should be dead or worse."~
@2476 = ~Ask the man why the village is so dangerous at night.~
@2477 = ~Ask the man if he has seen your mentor.~
@2478 = ~The man looks incredulously at you. "Ye daft, are ye? Ain't ye never heard of the curse? 'Tis the curse what makes travelin' the roads so treacherous. 'Tis the curse what makes good folk bar their doors and keep lamps lit all the night long." The man turns back to his dinner and says no more to you.~
@2479 = ~"Mentor, eh? Is he wearin' a cloak like yourself? He is, is he? Can't say I've seen him. Been here most of the day shelterin' from the gale, and I ain't seen nobody."~
@2480 = ~As you pass through the door behind the old man, a loose floorboard creaks beneath your weight. The old man starts, upsetting a plate of potatoes and knocking several on the floor. He turns to you with a look of terror that turns to relief followed by indignation upon recognizing you.~
@2481 = ~"By the Hells, I thought it had come for me! What's the matter with you, sneaking up behind good folk at this hour of night? Nearly gave me my death's fright, you did. Thought the terror had come for me, sure as my pap's grave." The man bends to clean up the potatoes, muttering to himself.~
@2482 = ~Ask the man what he means by "the terror."~
@2483 = ~"Haven't seen anyone but yourself and One-Eye Joe all day. You must have seen Joe eating at the bar as you came back here. Come to think of it, I did hear Essie Dawlins talking about a stranger in town dressed in a cloak. Maybe that's the feller you're looking for."~
@2484 = ~"Never heard of the Terror of Marynford? You really are new here, ain't ye? I'll not say much, as it's a bad omen to speak of such things after sundown, but I will tell ye that this town and the surrounding countryside carry a dark curse. Good folk don't venture outside at night, and those who do disappear." The man returns to cleaning the potatoes.~
@2485 = ~The wind clutches at your cloak and the rain blurs your vision as you step back outside. You make your way slowly in the darkness toward the back of the inn, stumbling over the rotting remains of ruined oaken kegs as you proceed.~
@2486 = ~You find nothing of note in the back of the inn aside from a mutt, cowering in an overturned crate with a hole cut in one side. You turn to reenter the tavern when something catches your eye. In the distance, you see a shadow silhouetted by the intermittent flashes of lightning.~
@2487 = ~Return to the interior of the tavern.~
@2488 = ~Follow the shadow.~
@2489 = ~Stay where you are and watch.~
@2490 = ~You move quickly in the direction of the shadow and are able to catch several more fleeting glimpses of it before losing sight of it entirely. You realize that in your haste you have become lost, and it is half an hour before you find the inn again.~
@2491 = ~You squint into the darkness for half an hour but catch no sight of the fleeting shadow again. Finally, shivering and soaked, you make your way back to the inn. As you approach the front porch, the air grows frigid around you and you hear footsteps approaching.~
@2492 = ~"Get indoors, ye fool! Now!" The old man grabs you and pulls you indoors, barring the door behind you. Seconds after the door is barred, there is a horrible shriek and a beating on the door. The bar is solid and the door holds, and soon the beating and shrieking stop. The old man disappears through a door behind the bar.~
@2493 = ~The old man hands you a rusted key and directs you to the stairs on the left side of the bar. You ascend, and the aged wood creaks in protest at your weight. The room is small, but the bed is soft and warm and you are soon asleep, though your dreams are plagued by a nameless horror.~
@2494 = ~You awake the next day to sunlight filtering through the grimy glass of your bedroom window. Dressing quickly, you descend the creaking stairs to find the common room of the inn deserted. You leave the key on the bar and exit through the main door.~
@2495 = ~The road to town is muddy and damp from the previous night's downpour, and your boots are heavy and soaked when you arrive in the square of the small town of Marynford.~
@2496 = ~The oaken doors are heavy and solemn as they silently swing closed behind you. An aging man clad in simple robes looks up from the altar to Lathander in the front of the temple. He smiles warmly as he sees you. "Hello, traveler, how may I be of service?"~
@2497 = ~Ask the man why the tavern owner bars his door at night.~
@2498 = ~Leave the temple.~
@2499 = ~"You say you are looking for a man clad in robes like yourself? I do believe I noticed someone fitting that description just yesterday. He was speaking to Essie Dawlins at her fruit stand in the town square. You might ask her about him."~
@2500 = ~The priest's face becomes grave. "It is good you have asked me, if you are not already aware. There is a curse upon Marynford and the surrounding lands. It has been so for years and years. Sadly, the curse originated within these very walls."~
@2501 = ~"My predecessor, a gifted and ambitious priest by the name of Brehan, desired to revive faith in Lathander among the people of Marynford. He preached, devoted his life to service, and offered assistance to all who were in need. Despite these measures, the devotion of the town remained tepid."~
@2502 = ~"Brehan became convinced that a display of power was needed to reveal the glory of Lathander to the villagers, so he undertook an expedition into a nearby ruin to rebuke and destroy a ghost that was rumored to reside there."~
@2503 = ~"He found and destroyed the ghost, but as the ghost faded from existence, it cursed him to eternal undeath. Brehan fell ill and soon became ghostly pale himself and increasingly terrified of the light of day."~
@2504 = ~"One morning, I entered the infirmary and found Brehan's attendant dead on the floor with two puncture wounds on her neck. The door to the temple was battered down, and a set of tracks led in the direction of the ancient ruins. Since then, those who venture out at night sometimes do not return."~
@2505 = ~Here. Take this talisman of Lathander. It may protect you if you run afoul of the beast.~
@2506 = ~The woman is young and pretty, and she smiles as you approach. "Two robed travelers in as many days. What a coincidence."~
@2507 = ~Ask the woman if she has seen your mentor.~
@2508 = ~Ask the woman why the tavern owner bars his doors at night.~
@2509 = ~Leave the woman.~
@2510 = ~"Yes, I have. Wearing a cloak similar to your own. He was buying food for a journey he was taking to the ruins south of town. Oh, I tried to warn him away, but he was resolute. I hope nothing has befallen him."~
@2511 = ~The woman turns pale and clutches the wooden table before her to steady herself. "We... we do not speak of such things. If you must know the answer to your question, ask the priest. He is in the temple. I... I can say no more about it. But take this garlic. It is said that the terror fears garlic."~
@2512 = ~"Howdy. I'm Bugs, and this here is Finney. We reckoned you were new around here 'cause we've never seen you before and we know just 'bout everyone in town. What brings you to these parts?"~
@2513 = ~Leave the men.~
@2514 = ~"Hmm... A feller wearin' a robe like yours? Hey, Finney, didn't you say you saw a feller like that talking to Essie Dawlins a few days back? Yeah. Go talk to Essie by her fruit stand. She may know somethin'."~
@2515 = ~"Hush now, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. We don't none of us talk about that out of doors. If you got questions 'bout that, best be asking the priest in the temple." He points to the temple of Lathander on the north side of the square.~
@2516 = ~You see a temple of Lathander on the north side of the square, a woman selling fruit to the east, and two young men talking under a tall oak in the center of the square. To the south, a road leads out of town and you think you see what appears to be a ruined tower in the distance.~
@2517 = ~Enter the temple.~
@2518 = ~Talk to the woman selling fruit.~
@2519 = ~Talk to the two men.~
@2520 = ~Follow the road to the south.~
@2521 = ~The south road appears little used, and the grass grows high on either side. You are lost in thought, pondering the fate of your mentor, when a figure leaps from hiding. The man is scarred heavily and points his sword at you. "Your money or your life, fool!"~
@2522 = ~Cast Magic Missile at the man.~
@2523 = ~Cast Sleep on the man.~
@2524 = ~Cast Charm Person on the man.~
@2525 = ~Try to flee.~
@2526 = ~Arcane power surges through you as you utter the final words of the incantation. The bandit's eyes widen as missiles of magical energy tear through his leather armor and throw him back on the road. He lies very, very still.~
@2527 = ~You search the man's corpse and find a few gold pieces. In his breast pocket where the magic missiles struck him, there appears to have been a letter. You try to read it, but much of it was destroyed by your magic. All you can make out is: "...talisman... Lathander..."~
@2528 = ~As your spell envelops the man, his features soften and he slumps to the road in a limp heap. You search him quickly and find a letter in his breast pocket. One section is of particular interest. It reads: "...procure a talisman of Lathander to protect yourself from the undead creature..."~
@2529 = ~You utter the last line of the incantation, and the man suddenly looks at his sword and chuckles. "Heh. What do I need this for, friend? Now, how may I be of service? Oh I know. I'll warn you of the danger in these parts."~
@2530 = ~"The villagers have somehow awakened an undead fiend, but there is a way to weaken it and drive it away. Simply acquire a talisman of Lathander, and it will not try to attack you. I am on my way to try to procure one this very day. Now, I must be off. Good luck!"~
@2531 = ~You turn and begin to run, but you are no match for the bandit's speed. He overtakes you, and you feel a burning pain in your back, then nothing at all as the ground rushes up to receive your dying body.~
@2532 = ~Oh, too bad. Looks like you have been slain. Better luck next time.~
@2533 = ~The bandit defeated, you stand on the lonely road. To the south lies the ancient ruin, and to the north lies the small town square.~
@2534 = ~Return to the town square.~
@2535 = ~Proceed south toward the ruin.~
@2536 = ~The magical projectiles streak unerringly toward their target and stop the charging skeleton in its tracks. Chunks of bone sail high into the air as it is obliterated.~
@2537 = ~Your spell leaves your fingers and settles over the undead creature, but it appears to be unaffected. The simple life force within the animated bones is immune to the enchantment. You struggle to begin another spell, but the undead monster is upon you and the ground rushes up to receive your lifeless body.~
@2538 = ~Eventually, you find yourself staring at crumbling stone walls and a decrepit tower, all that remain of a once-mighty fortress. As soon as you enter the ruined courtyard, a shriek erupts and a skeletal figure charges you!~
@2539 = ~Cast Magic Missile at the skeleton.~
@2540 = ~Cast Sleep at the skeleton.~
@2541 = ~Cast Charm person at the skeleton.~
@2542 = ~The courtyard has a ruined shed to the north which seems to have been visited recently. There is a ruined building to the south which appears undisturbed. There is also a dark doorway to the east which appears to have seen recent activity. Beside the door, you notice a shred of fabric the same color as your mentor's cloak.~
@2543 = ~Enter the ruined shed to the north.~
@2544 = ~Enter the undisturbed building to the south.~
@2546 = ~The rotten timber of the shed door gives way to your hand, and the decrepit wood falls to the ground before you, revealing a ghastly, dusty figure wrapped in strips of cloth, shambling forward from the darkness.~
@2547 = ~Cast Magic Missile at the mummy.~
@2548 = ~Cast Burning Hands at the mummy.~
@2549 = ~Cast Sleep at the mummy.~
@2550 = ~Cast Charm Person at the mummy.~
@2551 = ~The missiles strike the shambling figure and tear great holes in its chest. The creature stumbles to one knee, then slowly regains its footing, allowing you time to begin another spell.~
@2552 = ~Flames arc forward from your outstretched hands, and the shambling figure is engulfed in an inferno of bright flames. It falls to the ground and thrashes as it is reduced to ashes. Glancing about the shed reveals nothing of value.~
@2553 = ~Your spell leaves your fingers and settles over the undead creature, but it appears to be unaffected. The simple life force within the dusty wraps is immune to the enchantment. You struggle to begin another spell, but the undead monster is upon you and the ground rushes up to receive your lifeless body.~
@2554 = ~The grass grows high and thick around the undisturbed building, and there are even some delicate flowers here that grow nowhere else in the bleak ruins. The door is untouched by decay and swings in easily at your touch.~
@2555 = ~On the ground before you lies a set of silver armor flanked by a heavy mace and an intricately engraved shield. You note the symbol of Lathander on the breastplate of the armor. On the belt of the armor is a flask of water which glows with a faint holy light. You take the holy water for future use.~
@2556 = ~You step through the dark threshold, and the air chills around you. A piercing shriek echoes in your head as torches on the walls of the ancient crypt flare with an unearthly blue fire. You fall to one knee as you look up and see a pale figure with large fangs. A vampire.~
@2557 = ~Cast Magic Missile at the vampire.~
@2558 = ~Cast Burning Hands at the vampire.~
@2559 = ~Cast Sleep at the vampire.~
@2560 = ~Cast Charm Person at the vampire.~
@2561 = ~Brandish the symbol of Lathander.~
@2562 = ~Smash your clove of garlic and throw it at the vampire.~
@2563 = ~Throw the flask of holy water at the vampire.~
@2564 = ~The magical projectiles strike the vampire in the chest, but to your amazement and dismay leave only minor scorches on the skin of the undead monster. The creature winces slightly but continues to advance. You have time to prepare another spell.~
@2565 = ~The flames that arc forth from your hand singe the beast's skin and cause it to shield its eyes, but it is otherwise unharmed. The vampire advances slowly, giving you time to prepare another spell.~
@2566 = ~Your spell leaves your fingers and settles over the vampire. It smiles mockingly as it shrugs off your enchantment. You struggle to begin another spell, but the undead monster is upon you and the ground rushes up to receive your lifeless body.~
@2567 = ~As you hold up the talisman of Lathander, the crypt flares in a bright holy light. The vampire begins to smoke and stumbles back against the far wall quivering and covering its eyes.~
@2568 = ~As the cloves of garlic strike the vampire, it shudders... with laughter. "You would use garlic against me? You've been deceived by an old wives' tale, you fool!"~
@2569 = ~The flask shatters on the stone floor of the crypt, dousing the vampire in holy water. Its flesh begins to smoke and char, and it stumbles against the far wall of the crypt, cowering and shaking.~
@2570 = ~The missiles streak toward the weakened vampire and plow through its flesh, leaving an empty husk in their wake. The vampire slumps to the floor and dissolves into a cloud of gaseous mist which flees the room.~
@2571 = ~The gouts of flame strike the weakened vampire and soon set it ablaze. It shrivels and thrashes, then falls to the floor and slowly dissipates into a cloud of gaseous mist which flees the room.~
@2572 = ~The garlic strikes the weakened vampire—but does not affect it. "Fool!" it hisses. "You've been taken in by that old wives' tale?"~
@2573 = ~The holy water splashes the weakened vampire, and its flesh curls and chars as blue flames consume it. The vampire collapses on the floor and slowly dissipates into a cloud of gaseous mist which flees the room.~
@2574 = ~The holy symbol flares with searing light. Beams of energy pierce the weakened vampire, and its flesh curls and chars as blue flames consume it. The vampire collapses on the floor and slowly dissipates into a cloud of gaseous mist which flees the room.~
@2575 = ~You rush across the crypt to the next door and find your mentor slumped on the floor. Fearing the worst, you check his neck, and he stirs weakly. You realize he is still alive. Beside him is a wooden coffin, and you notice a tendril of gaseous mist escaping into it.~
@2576 = ~Take your master and flee the crypt.~
@2577 = ~Cast Burning Hands at the casket.~
@2578 = ~You hoist your master over your shoulder and begin the arduous trek back to town. You emerge from the crypt and find that night is fast approaching. You walk as quickly as you can, but with your heavy burden, you are unable to reach the safety of town before nightfall.~
@2579 = ~You become aware of a presence behind you moments before you are struck heavily on your back. You fall to the ground and roll onto your back just as the vampire fastens its fangs to your neck and the world fades to blackness.~
@2580 = ~The wood of the coffin bursts into flame and a shrieking sound reverberates through the crypt as it disintegrates. The shrieking sound subsides, and the crypt is left quiet and lifeless. You shoulder the burden of your mentor and begin the long journey back to town.~
@2581 = ~You arrive in town late at night and find all the doors in town barred. You shout and pound on the doors of the temple of Lathander until a small window above is opened. The priest instantly recognizes you and lets you in.~
@2582 = ~"By the gods! How have you survived out of doors so late? And your friend! He is in need of aid. I shall take him to the infirmary as you tell me your tale."~
@2583 = ~Over the next few days, your mentor regains his health, and the townspeople no longer see the terror stalking at night. They give you what gifts their modest incomes allow and herald you as a hero. When your mentor recovers, you continue your journey together to Waterdeep to pursue your arcane studies there.~
@2584 = ~Wow! That was pretty good. You did it. I guess there isn't any challenge that you cannot overcome. That's a fun game.~
@2585 = ~Ooh, a thief! That's fun. You know, I once stole something. Yep. It's true. There was a pie pan by the bedroom window of a villager back in Nashkel, and it was completely full. I stole it and took a bite. Turns out it was actually a bed pan. Never really had a taste for pie after that.~
@2586 = ~Yeah, so let me just get my Tome of Adventure and we can begin the game. Okay, here it is. Let's start!~
@2587 = ~You are a professional thief, and a rather talented one at that. You have spent most of your career performing jobs for various trade guilds, mercenary groups, and the occasional noble here and there.~
@2588 = ~Your last job went well, but the noble who hired you cheated you on your payment. In an attempt to recoup your losses, you broke into his personal offices, searching for his safe.~
@2589 = ~Instead, you found a stash of documents which indicated the location of a powerful magical ring owned by a rich merchant in the nearby town of Galenwood. The papers explained that the ring was able to amplify the wearer's natural talents of sneaking and innate dexterity. Apparently, the noble had intentions of stealing the ring for himself.~
@2590 = ~To your astonishment, the documents also hinted that the ring had the ability to turn its wearer invisible as well. The location of the house, and even the location of the safe room in which the ring is kept, were indicated in the documents. You took them and proceeded to the town of Galenwood immediately.~
@2591 = ~The road to Galenwood is heavily wooded, with thick underbrush on either side. Thick tree branches extend across the road just above head level and form a canopy which shields the road from direct sunlight.~
@2592 = ~As you reflect on the beauty of the scene, you hear movement and voices behind you. The voices are distant, but your sharp ears are able to pick up a few words, "...will be rewarded for getting the documents back... thief won't get far..." Looking back, you see nothing and realize you have not been seen yet. You have a few minutes to act.~
@2593 = ~Stand in the road and await your pursuers.~
@2594 = ~Set a trap beneath the leaves on the road.~
@2595 = ~Climb into the branches directly above the road.~
@2596 = ~In a few minutes, you see two men walk into view. They are clad in chain mail and carry swords and shields. You recognize them as the guards of the noble who cheated you. They stop in surprise at seeing you. Recognition crosses their faces. One shouts, "It's <PRO_HIMHER>!" and they charge at you.~
@2597 = ~Stand your ground.~
@2598 = ~Slip into the underbrush on the side of the road.~
@2599 = ~The guards reach you in a matter of seconds. You parry the thrust of the first guard with your short sword, but the second guard dazes you with a shield block to the face. You stumble backwards and feel a searing pain in your chest. Then the world around you goes black.~
@2600 = ~You leap onto the trunk of a nearby tree and almost make it out of reach, but the guards are too swift. One of them fastens an iron grip around your ankle, and you fall heavily to the ground. The last thing you see is a sword descending toward your exposed throat.~
@2601 = ~Your hands work feverishly but you are still crouched over your trap, setting tools, when the guards reach you. You look up, and the last thing you see is a sword descending toward your exposed neck.~
@2602 = ~You roll fluidly into the underbrush on the side of the road and creep noiselessly forward with practiced stealth. The guards follow you, hacking away at the plant life with their swords.~
@2603 = ~You easily double back and creep up from behind, slipping your short sword through a seam in the trailing guard's armor. Before the other can react, you leap forward and cut his throat, letting him fall silently to the ground. You quickly conceal the bodies and return to the path.~
@2604 = ~You work quickly and methodically, setting up a simple yet effective poison dart trap. You just finish concealing the pressure plate when two men walk into view. They are clad in chain mail and carry swords and shields.~
@2605 = ~You recognize them as the guards of the noble who cheated you. They stop in surprise at seeing you. Recognition crosses their faces. One shouts, "It's <PRO_HIMHER>!" and they charge at you.~
@2606 = ~You retreat several steps and watch in satisfaction as the first of the guards runs right into your trap. Poison darts spring from the brush on either side of the road, piercing the first guard multiple times. He gasps and falls quivering to the ground as the poison takes effect.~
@2607 = ~The second guard is hit once in the flank. He stumbles, and his pace slows, but he continues his attack. Your poison has sapped much of his strength, and you easily parry his attacks and counterattack with successful strikes of your own.~
@2608 = ~In a matter of minutes, the second guard lies dead at your feet, his life's blood staining the road. You quickly conceal the bodies and all signs of the struggle as best you can.~
@2609 = ~You easily make your way into the branches and wait silently. In a few minutes, you see two men walk into view. They are clad in chain mail and carry swords and shields. You recognize them as the guards of the noble who cheated you. They are boasting of their recent exploits with a local barmaid and do not notice you.~
@2610 = ~You wait until they pass, then drop noiselessly behind them, quickly sliding your blade into a weak spot in one of the guard's armor. His lung punctured, he drops noiselessly to the ground.~
@2611 = ~A second later, the second guard notices that his companion is missing and turns, but he is too slow. You lunge at him and bury your short sword in his exposed neck before he can ready his guard. You quickly conceal the bodies and all signs of the struggle as best you can.~
@2612 = ~Oh, too bad! Looks like you lost. Well, it was a fun game anyway. Next time, try to be a little more sneaky.~
@2613 = ~Having dealt with the guards, you continue your journey to Galenwood, treading a little more carefully and keeping an ear to the wind and an eye on your back. After a few uneventful hours of travel, you arrive at the gates of the small town and make your way discreetly to the town square.~
@2614 = ~You stand in the bustling town square of Galenwood. To the north is a large house which matches the description of the merchant's house in the documents. To the south is a temple of Helm. To the east is a tavern, and beside the tavern is an alley. A man dressed in fine blue clothes can be seen going from the merchant's house to the alley and back, periodically.~
@2615 = ~Enter the temple of Helm.~
@2616 = ~Enter the tavern.~
@2617 = ~Follow the finely dressed man to the alley.~
@2618 = ~Approach the merchant's house.~
@2619 = ~The interior of the temple is dappled in subtle shades of blue and amber as the sunlight filters in through the ornate stained glass windows of the temple. To your left, several people are praying fervently. At the altar, an acolyte appears to be tending to temple duties.~
@2620 = ~Move closer and listen to the prayers.~
@2621 = ~Approach the acolyte.~
@2622 = ~Return outside.~
@2623 = ~You look up and make a show of admiring the intricate carvings on the ceiling as you slowly wander within hearing of the people's prayers. You make out a few words.~
@2624 = ~"...And I pray that you will forgive him for his sins. He is just a simple guard and very handsome. It isn't any fault of his own that the rich merchant's wife fell in love with him and gave him the locket with their names inscribed upon it..." You make note of the information for future use.~
@2625 = ~The young acolyte appears startled as you approach. Your sharp and well-trained eyes see his hands quickly draw back from the temple's offering box. The acolyte follows your gaze, and the expression of horror and surprise on his face tells you he is at your mercy.~
@2626 = ~He begins to speak as his shock subsides. "I... I know things. I know people. I can tell you anything, just... just don't tell the priest! Oh, don't tell Father McNeil!"~
@2627 = ~"The manor house... well... it's owned by Phineas Undergood. He's rich. The richest man in a hundred leagues and more. His steward, Alder Lathel, carries the key to his most prized possession. Alder is always dressed in blue and can be found most days running errands to the tavern."~
@2628 = ~Elegant appointments brighten the interior of this tavern. Several attractive young barmaids are busy serving ale and food to patrons in the crowded common room. In one corner, you see a man in chain mail armor emblazoned with a symbol that you noticed on the large house on the north side of the square.~
@2629 = ~Offer to buy a drink for one of the barmaids.~
@2630 = ~Buy a drink for the man in chain mail armor.~
@2631 = ~The young girl smiles an enchantingly pretty smile, then speaks with the most hideous voice you have ever heard in your entire life. "Don't mind if I do, love. Me bum's burnin' from all this standin'. Makes me arse twitch, ya know?"~
@2632 = ~The girl sits heavily and downs the entire mug in one swallow, then belches loudly. "Aye, that's good ale. Heh, reminds me of that time when summat else bought me an ale. That guard outside the manor house, ya know? He bought me one to keep me quiet."~
@2633 = ~"Ya see, I was sittin' in the outhouse and heard that good-lookin' guard talkin' to the lady of the manor. Looked out the peephole I did, and saw her give him this locket, had their names engraved on it. When he found out I knew, he bought me drinks to get me fuddled. Didn't work though. Remembered the whole thing."~
@2634 = ~The man looks up at you angrily until he sees the flagon of ale in your hand. "Aye, now you're speaking my language. Cheers, mate." He takes the ale and starts drinking. Four flagons later, he starts talking. "Gave my whole life to that heartless wretch, working in his house, guarding his possessions."~
@2635 = ~"Then one day, he up and fires me just to save a few gold coins. I was the one who designed the trap to guard his most prized possession, that damned ring of his. Put it right above the chandelier where nobody'd think to look. Can't believe he fired me."~
@2636 = ~"Got half a mind to steal the ring myself. Since I know about the trap in the chandelier, I only need to get past the guard at the front door and then get the key to the lock and the ring will be mine." The man sways a second after speaking, then falls snoring to the table, spilling the rest of the ale.~
@2637 = ~You wait until the man has his back turned and then slip in the alley behind him. He goes to the back of the tavern and bends over a box, fumbling with the contents. You have a chance to act while his attention is distracted.~
@2638 = ~Attempt to pick his pockets.~
@2639 = ~Your trained hands quickly locate the key in the man's pocket and remove it undetected. You complete the job almost without breaking stride and return to the town square before you attract any attention.~
@2640 = ~You easily slip your hands in the distracted man's various pockets, but are unable to notice anything of value before you must move back to the town square to avoid attracting attention. Perhaps if you knew what you were looking for, you could try again later.~
@2641 = ~You approach the richly decorated house and are promptly halted by a tall and handsome guard at the front door. "Halt. What business do you have with the Undergood Estate?" You realize that if you manage to enter the house, you will not be able to leave and then reenter. You have only one chance once inside.~
@2642 = ~Claim to be a safe inspector sent for by the master of the house.~
@2643 = ~Attempt to overpower the guard.~
@2644 = ~Blackmail the guard with the information about his affair with his master's wife.~
@2645 = ~The guard narrows his eyes for a moment, then enters the house without a word, locking the door behind him. He returns a few moments later with a hard look on his face. "The master's clerk of business knows of no such appointment. Now move along before you find yourself in the stocks."~
@2646 = ~You lunge for the guard's throat, but he is ready. His trained muscles quickly overpower you, and you feel a burning pain at your throat as the guard's dagger is drawn quickly across it. The ground rushes up to meet you as the world goes black.~
@2647 = ~The large man's rugged face pales, and his eyes grow wide. His right hand instinctively clutches at something just below the collar of his tunic. His eyes darting left and right, he silently moves aside, allowing you to pass.~
@2648 = ~You find yourself in the grand entrance of the elegant mansion. Referring to your papers, you find the hallway that leads to the mansion's safe room. It is a long corridor with a painting on the left side, a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a rug on the floor, and a statue on the right side.~
@2649 = ~Proceed to the door of the safe room.~
@2650 = ~Check the painting for a trap.~
@2651 = ~Check the chandelier for a trap.~
@2652 = ~Check the rug for a trap.~
@2653 = ~Check the statue for a trap.~
@2654 = ~You stride boldly toward your goal at the end of the corridor. Halfway there, you hear a barely audible twang and feel a sting at the back of your neck.~
@2655 = ~You carefully examine the painting, but find no traces of tripwires, pressure plates, or other conventional triggers. As you step back to think about your next move, you hear a barely audible twang and feel a sting at the back of your neck.~
@2656 = ~Reaching back, you find a dart protruding from you skin and you realize to your horror that you have triggered a trap. Your vision blurs from the poison dart, and soon your knees buckle. You never feel yourself hit the floor.~
@2657 = ~As you look closely at the chandelier, you see a small network of tiny filaments extending from the ornamental arms of the light fixture to the floor. Where they attach to the chandelier, there are small levers, almost too small to detect.~
@2658 = ~You carefully examine the rug, but find no traces of tripwires, pressure plates, or other conventional triggers. As you step back to think about your next move, you hear a barely audible twang and feel a sting at the back of your neck.~
@2659 = ~You carefully examine the statue, but find no traces of tripwires, pressure plates, or other conventional triggers. As you step back to think about your next move, you hear a barely audible twang and feel a sting at the back of your neck.~
@2660 = ~You carefully avoid the filaments hanging from the chandelier and make your way to the safe room door. It appears to be a normal door with a simple lock below the doorknob.~
@2661 = ~Try to pick the lock.~
@2662 = ~Place the stolen key in the lock and turn it.~
@2663 = ~You produce your lockpicking tools and begin to work on the lock. The tumblers turn easily beneath your expert fingers, and soon the lock clicks. You stand up triumphantly. Then you hear another click, then a twang. Something strikes the back of your neck.~
@2664 = ~Looking back over your shoulder, you see no one in the corridor. You take a few steps back, then throw your full weight against the door. It gives slightly, then holds solid. Throughout the house, bells sound, and the house fills with the sound of running feet.~
@2665 = ~The corridor fills with guards carrying crossbows, and seconds later the air is full of humming quarrels. The quarrels find their mark, and you drop to your knees. The world fades to blackness.~
@2666 = ~The lock opens silently, and as you open the door, you find that it is comprised of two inches of solid iron. The hinges make no sound whatsoever as you close the door behind you. You turn and survey the room.~
@2667 = ~To your surprise, you see a window overlooking the busy town square. Despite the window, the room seems surprisingly dark, and this strikes you as odd. There is a table with a small stand which holds a simple gold ring. You quickly take the ring and plan your escape.~
@2668 = ~Attempt to leave through the strangely dark window.~
@2669 = ~Slip the ring on your finger and exit the way you entered.~
@2670 = ~You attempt to open the window, but your hands pass through and push against a metallic plate behind it. As bells sound throughout the house, you realize too late that the window was an illusion.~
@2671 = ~Guards fling the door open and train their crossbows on you. The air hums as their bolts streak toward their target. The quarrels find their mark, and you drop to your knees. The world fades to blackness.~
@2672 = ~You slip the ring on your finger, and the world around you shimmers briefly as the magic cloaks you in invisibility. You exit through the safe room door, taking care to lock it behind you. You return to the grand entry and patiently wait for the door to the square to open.~
@2673 = ~After what seems like an eternity, an elegant middle-aged woman passes through the door with a lingering gaze on the tall guard. You take the opportunity to pass unseen into the square and shortly thereafter out of the city.~
@2674 = ~You travel swiftly for three days until you are certain that you have not been pursued. Only then do you take off the ring and spend the night in a small, nearly deserted tavern. After a surprisingly good dinner, you retire to your room and fall asleep, dreaming of the riches which are sure to be yours.~
@2675 = ~You did it! Well done. Wasn't sure you would make it there toward the end, but you did! Well, that certainly was fun.~
@2676 = ~Oh well, you died, but this has been known to happen in this game. Despite this, was it a fun game?~
@2677 = ~Yes, I enjoyed it very much.~
@2678 = ~Well, it was a game.~
@2679 = ~It wasn't very good, no.~
@2680 = ~So what did you think? Was it a fun game?~
@2681 = ~I'm glad to hear it. Would you, by chance, like to play again or perhaps choose another class?~
@2682 = ~Okay, perhaps I will try another class.~
@2683 = ~No, I would rather quit.~
@2684 = ~Yes, it is definitely a game. Would you, by chance, like to play again or perhaps choose another class?~
@2685 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. Perhaps trying another class would improve your experience. Would you like to try?~
@2686 = ~Quit? I can't believe you'd really choose to quit such a fun game. Are you sure?~
@2687 = ~Yes, I am sure.~
@2688 = ~Excellent! Which class would you like: a fighter, a wizard, or a thief?~
@2689 = ~A wizard sounds like it would be fun.~
@2690 = ~I've always enjoyed sneaking around. Let me try being a thief.~
@2691 = ~Eh, I would rather quit after all.~
@2692 = ~Yes, even now.~
@2693 = ~What about now?~
@2694 = ~Oh, not this again!~
@2695 = ~This is dumb.~
@2696 = ~Yes, it is STILL dumb.~
@2697 = ~Can we please stop this?~
@2698 = ~I want to kill you so badly. I'm just... it's amazing, really.~
@2699 = ~Really, just stop.~
@2700 = ~You have no idea how much I loathe you.~
@2701 = ~You are the most reprehensible creature in the entire world.~
@2702 = ~It appears my time is up, my friend. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>! It has been quite the adventure this past while. Perhaps we shall see each other again some day.~
@2703 = ~I'd like to buy some of these servants' uniforms.~
@2704 = ~I need some liquor.~
@2705 = ~I'm looking for some poison.~
@2706 = ~I need to get a message to Joker.~
@2707 = ~Well enough, thanks. Farewell.~
@2708 = ~That can be arranged for 500 gold pieces each.~
@2709 = ~Here's the gold.~
@2710 = ~I could buy the finest silks and leathers for that kind of money. Forget it.~
@2711 = ~Nice doing business with you.~
@2712 = ~Don't we all? I think one of the clerics keeps a stash. They're probably not the only ones. This place will drive you to drink.~
@2713 = ~Could I buy some of these servants' uniforms?~
@2714 = ~I don't doubt it. I'm looking for some poison. Can you help me with that?~
@2715 = ~I'd like to ask Joker about that. Could you get a message to her for me?~
@2716 = ~Thanks. Farewell.~
@2717 = ~Why would you—never mind, I don't want to know. I'm sure the kitchen must have something to deal with the rats. Have you tried the merchants yet? Or some of your fellow performers, perhaps?~
@2718 = ~Good ideas, all. I'll try them out. On a different subject, may I have some of these servants' uniforms?~
@2719 = ~That's one poison taken care of. Do you know where I might find some of the more enjoyable kind? I need a drink.~
@2720 = ~I need to get a message to Joker. Can you do that for me?~
@2721 = ~That'll be all. Thank you.~
@2722 = ~Sure. We take messages up and down all the time.~
@2723 = ~Tell Joker I challenge her to a drinking contest.~
@2724 = ~Mention to her I have a drink so strong it'll knock her on her rear.~
@2725 = ~I'll bear that in mind. Thanks.~
@2726 = ~Seriously? Well, if you want to die, there are worse ways to go, I suppose. I'll give her the message.~
@2727 = ~I'll tell her next time I see her. I'm sure she'll come running to find you.~
@2728 = ~Shadowstep~
@2729 = ~Aye, slave. Ye need weapons, do ye? I've the best selection in the pits right here.~
@2730 = ~Let's see what you've got.~
@2731 = ~What's your story?~
@2732 = ~My story is I sell weapons! Now are you buyin' or walkin'?~
@2733 = ~I'm looking. Let me see your selection.~
@2734 = ~<CHARNAME>, what's going on out there?~
@2735 = ~No talking here! No talking!~
@2736 = ~Please, don't tell him...~
@2737 = ~What'll happen to us?~
@2738 = ~Sorry, can't talk. Marduuk won't allow it.~
@2739 = ~Go get 'em, <CHARNAME>! Strike a blow for us all!~
@2740 = ~We've seen you in the arena. Can we talk?~
@2741 = ~We can't take it anymore.~
@2742 = ~The cook LOVES mushrooms.~
@2743 = ~Quick, Marduuk, let's get back—I think I hear the cook.~
@2744 = ~Come, Marduuk, let's go back—I hear the cook looking for us.~
@2745 = ~That's not my real name. Cook thought it'd be funny to give me a nickname like Dennaton does with the arena performers.~
@2746 = ~It's been going on like this for YEARS.~
@2747 = ~You didn't say he'd die, Marduuk! You said he'd just get sick and take to his bed a tenday or two. Gods! What have we done?~
@2748 = ~If you say so...~
@2749 = ~Shhh! He'll—~
@2750 = ~Marduuk…~
@2751 = ~Oh. Hello. You speak to me, I suppose? Salutations are certainly suitable in this social situation. Query me quickly.~ [OH92303]
@2752 = ~Can I ask you a question?~
@2753 = ~Your voice and manner seem familiar... Have we met before?~
@2754 = ~Great. Another fool infatuated with the sound of his own voice. ~
@2755 = ~So soon? Has the entrapped expert elucidated entertainment in these halls of incarceration? Very well. Enjoy your enslavement.~ [OH92307]
@2756 = ~Your banal beratements and barbaric bluster are of no consequence to a cultivated consciousness. Wicked words are wasted. Good day.~ [OH92308]
@2757 = ~Who am I? I insist on immediate information illuminating your identity. Who are you?~ [OH92309]
@2758 = ~Huh? What?~
@2759 = ~Who I am isn't as important as why I'm here. Answer my question.~
@2760 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. And you are...?~
@2761 = ~Never mind. I'm leaving.~
@2762 = ~You think yourself clever. You aren't.~
@2763 = ~Have my multisyllabic musings mesmerized your miniature mind? My deepest regrets. I shall speak more simply in consideration of the diminutive degree of your deductive devices.~ [OH92314]
@2764 = ~What profound perception you possess, my precocious performer! I know why you've been hauled to these halls, and that information is indeed more important than your identity. Now I shall give you mine.~ [OH92315]
@2765 = ~<CHARNAME>. The rampant rumors of your recent residence are ratified. I am not surprised to see you here. Do not be shocked. My profession requires I know all persons of prominence and prosperity parading in the pit. Now you shall know my name.~ [OH92316]
@2766 = ~I am the sultan of scholars! The regent of recorders! The baron of bards! Sought by pashas, kings, lords, and emperors alike to chronicle the conquests and catastrophes of our time. ~ [OH92317]
@2767 = ~Dennaton caught you too, huh?~
/* removing black pits references by renaming the book baeloth's writing */
@2768 = ~Caught? No, no, my sad, cynical soldier of ill fortune. I am here of my own consent, to craft "The Pits of Despair: Bhaalspawn you best beware." That's the working title of my current compendium of characters cunning, captivating, and—in your case—contentious and cantankerous.~
@2769 = ~What?~
@2770 = ~I am the renowned, the beloved, the exalted, the inestimable Stannel Eibor! May you rejoice in the good fortune of meeting me in person!~ [OH92318]
@2771 = ~I might do that later. Can I ask you a question?~
@2772 = ~Stannel Eibor? Never heard of you. Excuse me.~
@2773 = ~Stannel Eibor? Sounds like a disease.~
@2774 = ~You find my phonetics familiar? Please indulge my egotistic interest and inform me who speaks so similarly to this simple scribe. A king, perhaps? The lord of a great city?~ [OH92322]
@2775 = ~Neither a king nor a lord. It was Baeloth the Entertainer.~
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pits */
@2776 = ~A drow I met while traversing the Sword Coast. Baeloth was his name.~
/* removing references to Baeloth's Pits */
@2777 = ~His name, I believe, was Baeloth. We travelled together for a time.~
@2778 = ~Yes, I remember now. It was the town idiot where I grew up.~
@2779 = ~Ah... Yes. Through a certain sister's second servant's son, we are somehow siblings. No doubt the similarity of speech springs from our sires. Baeloth is a gifted and generous businessman. You were lucky to have made his acquaintance.~ [OH92327]
@2780 = ~That explains it. Can I ask you something else?~
@2781 = ~In my experience, siblings rarely speak so similarly. ~
@2782 = ~A very... thorough answer. I must be going.~
@2783 = ~I see the surprisingly strong similarity of stupidity. ~
@2784 = ~Extraordinary individuals exhibit extraordinary traits, and my antecedents were extraordinary in the extreme. Now excuse me, I have writing to attend to.~ [OH92332]
@2785 = ~The dashing duelist, the persistent pugilist, the gallant gladiator returns! Have you a moment to discuss your latest match?~ [OH90675]
@2786 = ~I would be happy to.~
@2787 = ~No, but could I ask you a question?~
@2788 = ~Not now, I must be on my way.~
@2789 = ~Get away from me, you dusty scribe.~
@2790 = ~Foolish fighter! You have asked already. You may as well ask another.~ [OH90680]
@2791 = ~What exactly is your role here?~
@2792 = ~Certainly. A learned person such as yourself could help me with a perplexing problem.~
@2793 = ~I know of someone interested in one of your possessions.~
@2794 = ~My role cannot be related by mere words. I preserve for permanent posterity the power and prestige of the pits' performers. My works will line the shelves of libraries in every city.~ [OH90686]
@2795 = ~My characters and stories will be the talk of nobles and nobodies alike. Barons and barmaids, kings and knaves, lords and lackeys—all shall cherish my chapters. ~ [OH90687]
@2796 = ~You have the distinction of being a part of this timeless tale. Consider well your words and actions before the arena audience. There are others who have the makings of a hero. ~ [OH90688]
@2797 = ~Displease the crowd and these others will surely pinch your place as plucky protagonist.~ [OH90689]
@2798 = ~Thanks for the advice. Can I ask you a question?~
@2799 = ~It takes more than a hero to make a story. I wonder whose tale this really is...~
@2800 = ~Thanks for the advice. I must be going now.~
@2801 = ~Become the hero of a story written by you? No thanks.~
@2802 = ~Ah, a perceptive performer. Your reflections are right, my determined detective. There is more here than meets the eye. Come close and I shall share a secret with you. ~ [OH90694]
@2803 = ~Dennaton is not the only one behind these pits. There is another, whose name few will say in a voice above a whisper. I do not speak in whispers, so I'll not say it myself.~ [OH90695]
@2804 = ~Interesting, if not entirely helpful. Can I ask you a question?~
@2805 = ~Coward.~
@2806 = ~That was about as useful as I expected, which is to say, not at all. I'll be going now.~
@2807 = ~No problem can long perplex or puzzle my preponderance of perception. Ask away!~ [OH90699]
@2808 = ~Do you have any advice on how to handle some of the creatures in these pits?~
@2809 = ~Where in these pits could I get my hands on some poison?~
@2810 = ~Who makes the best scrolls around here? Magical scrolls, I mean, not the sort you write.~
@2811 = ~Gods! I can't take any more of your nonsensical yammering. Good day!~
@2812 = ~Indeed I do. My knowledge of monsters is monumental! Listen to my lore and live longer. The umber hulks and mind flayers will try to baffle, befuddle, and bedevil your brain. Protect your mind from them if you can.~ [OH90705]
@2813 = ~Demons and devils have been acquired for the arena. They are enemies in the extreme—evade them and observe as each eviscerates the other.~ [OH90706]

@2815 = ~Very helpful. Can I ask you a question?~
@2816 = ~Thanks for that detailed description of the overwhelmingly obvious. Bloody Hells, now I'm starting to talk like you.~
@2817 = ~Interest in my items? People peruse my possessions? Do tell!~ [OH90711]
@2818 = ~One of the merchants is interested in a ring you possess.~
@2819 = ~By the gods, your speeches are infuriating! I'm leaving.~
@2820 = ~Requesting my ring? I may relinquish such regalia... for a reasonable rate. 2,000 gold pieces.~ [OH90715]
@2821 = ~A fair price.~
@2822 = ~I shall return when I have enough. For now, I bid you farewell.~
@2823 = ~Forget it, then. I've got to go.~
@2824 = ~2,000 gold for THAT piece of tin? You're a better jester than scribe, Stannel Eibor.~
@2825 = ~And here you go. Accept my accoutrement with avid amiability.~ [OH90719]
@2826 = ~For potent potions, visit the vendor with the miserable myconid. Those are the strongest and the best.~ [OH90720]
@2827 = ~I'll do that. May I ask another question?~
@2828 = ~Myconids are the giant mushroom men, yes? Thanks for the tip. Now I must go.~
@2829 = ~ I already knew that. Thanks for nothing.~
@2830 = ~The ancient arcanist, Dulf Ebonbeard, is the supreme scriber of scrolls. Those who seek scrolls I send to that seasoned, sometimes seemingly senile soul.~ [OH92483]
@2831 = ~I'll seek him out, then. Thanks for the advice. Can I ask another question?~
@2832 = ~Ebonbeard's the fellow with the flowing white beard, isn't he? I'll pay him a visit. For now, I must be going.~
@2833 = ~Your run here is off to a rousing start! I hear this battle involved a pack of bloodthirsty orcs. Can you elaborate?~ [OH94538]
@2834 = ~Dennaton wanted the crowd warmed up, so I was forced to put the orcs down.~
@2835 = ~A senseless battle. I've faced more formidable summer breezes. I can't believe anyone found that slaughter entertaining.~
@2836 = ~It was over the moment I walked into the arena. In only a few seconds, I personally slew a dozen orcs!~
/* removing references of baeloth's pits, altering voiced line */
@2837 = ~I'm sure prevailing over that pack of portly pig-people proved a perplexing puzzle for a preeminent pugilist like the purported "Hero of Baldur's Gate."~ [ZBPOD8]
/* changes 'butcher' to 'Bhaalspawn' for BG2EE tie-in */
@2838 = ~But let's not belabor the business! How's this sound: "Bagged from their natural habitat, a bold band of orcs bravely battled a bloodthirsty Bhaalspawn!"~ [OH94543]
@2839 = ~That has a bit of a spin on it, but... all right.~
@2840 = ~I see the notion of subject neutrality is alive and well, "historian."~
@2841 = ~Good. Chapter Two will be about that same butcher slicing open the arena scribe.~
@2842 = ~This chronicle is sure to be a bestseller!~ [OH94547]
@2843 = ~Oh, thanks! That quote really fleshes out your rabid ruthlessness to my more refined readers!~ [OH94548]
@2844 = ~So, I understand this latest fight had a bit of excitement before it even began?~ [OH94108]
@2845 = ~Aye. Some other gladiators attacked Dennaton before the match. He was merciless in his reprisals.~
@2846 = ~There was a rebellion. A very short one.~
@2847 = ~It was nothing compared to the excitement that came from me butchering another batch of fodder!~
@2848 = ~Here's the story: "The Thayan fighters fought fiercely but futilely for their freedom. Our famous hero finished the forlorn fugitives off!"~ [OH94113]
@2849 = ~THAT's what you got from what I said?~
@2850 = ~It was nothing like that.~
@2851 = ~Say what you want about those fools, but make sure the butchering part's in there.~
@2852 = ~You are a scintillating subject! This chronicle is SURE to be a bestseller!~ [OH94119]
@2853 = ~Amazing adventure! Epic entertainment! Someone with the ability to lay low loads of lizardmen only comes by... what, once a tenday? Would you like to give a statement?~ [OH94176]
@2854 = ~Dennaton seems intent on giving me overmatched opponents so he can build my reputation among his clients.~
@2855 = ~Another ridiculously easy fight, over almost before it began.~
@2856 = ~I came, I saw, I conquered. That's my statement.~
@2857 = ~A rare moment of rectitude! I shall record the following: "Ruthlessly ripped from their regular habitat, the noble savages resolutely resisted a relentless rival resolved upon their ruin!"~ [OH94182]
@2858 = ~You understand I've been kidnapped and my life is in danger too, right?~
@2859 = ~Do you even listen to what I say?~
@2860 = ~I can see the day I have to thrash you coming already.~
@2861 = ~You are, as ever, a scintillating subject! This chronicle is SURE to be a bestseller!~ [OH94189]
@2862 = ~So, you were pitted against some dangerous denizens of the depths! Umber hulks, correct?~ [OH94210]
/* vanilla had a typo, i'm fixing it because why not? */
@2863 = ~Aye. Their ability to confuse was challenging, but ultimately I triumphed!~
@2864 = ~They were just mindless beasts doing what they do. Unfortunately, I had little choice but to kill them.~
@2865 = ~They WERE umber hulks. Now they're DEAD umber hulks.~
@2866 = ~"The petrified beasts were pressed into the pit at pike point. There, a psychotic <PRO_RACE> playfully cut them to pieces for the people's pleasure!" What do you think?~ [OH94214]
@2867 = ~Listen, you have me all wrong.~
@2868 = ~You're just a hack, aren't you?~
@2869 = ~I just noticed how long your quill is. If I went in through your eye, I bet I could write on the back of your skull.~
@2870 = ~Does it matter? This story has bestseller written all over it!~ [OH94218]
@2871 = ~"...back of your skull." Mm, fabulous quote! The readers will love it.~ [OH94219]
@2872 = ~According to the schedule, a group of drow were your latest opponents.~ [OH94261]
@2873 = ~Correct. They were ferocious combatants, but in the end, their dark spider goddess could not save them.~
@2874 = ~Why do you even ask me about my fights? You already have the story written.~
/* removing references to baeloth's pits */
@2875 = ~They fell all too easily. Not even the legendary drow can hope to stand against me.~
@2876 = ~Your declaration was the drivel of a deluded dimwit! Here's how it happened: "The drow were driven to defend themselves by a dogged enemy determined to decimate them. They were diabolically destroyed, their bodies disgustingly disfigured by the depraved devil."~ [OH94265]
@2877 = ~It was absolutely nothing like that!~
@2878 = ~Your propaganda is getting out of control.~
@2879 = ~You know I can't wait to kill you, right?~
/* removing references to baeloth's pits, removed voiced line */
@2880 = ~Your confidence so easily rings false, <CHARNAME>.~ [ZBLANK]
@2881 = ~With you as its subject, this chronicle will surely be a bestseller!~ [OH94270]
@2882 = ~You have undone the unbeatable undead! How does it feel?~ [OH94868]
@2883 = ~Glorious. Those vile creatures shall no longer trouble the good folk of Thay.~
@2884 = ~The undead are an abomination. I did what was necessary, nothing more.~
@2885 = ~Even a vampire lord's power pales in comparison to my own!~
@2886 = ~Most candid. I thank you. Here's how history will remember the battle: "Weakened by the arena's light, the vampires fell prey to the petty pranks of a pitiful performer."~ [OH94872]
@2887 = ~You do me a great dishonor.~
@2888 = ~No one will be convinced by your lies.~
@2889 = ~Undeath's eternal torment is nothing compared to what I'll do to you.~
@2890 = ~Sorry that your sentiments suffer so severely, but I am the scribe. Trust my experience and instinct for what the masses desire.~ [OH94876]
@2891 = ~Great! A quarrelsome quip to finish the chapter. My deepest thanks. ~ [OH94877]
@2892 = ~You have defied death, deftly defeated the descendants of Gith herself! Dazzle me with details!~ [OH95019]
@2893 = ~They fought well with blade and magic, but I could not let them live to wreak havoc on this plane. ~
@2894 = ~I fought out of necessity. To survive, I had little choice but to kill them.~
@2895 = ~The terror that precedes death is the same for all creatures regardless their plane of origin.~
@2896 = ~I see. Let me just finish writing, and... THERE! "Still stunned by their sudden snatching, the githyanki were soon slaughtered by the slovenly sod, <CHARNAME>."~ [OH95043]
@2897 = ~It isn't true! Please, change the record.~
@2898 = ~Go on, then. I'm sick of trying to correct you.~
@2899 = ~I shall pierce your flesh a hundred times for each lie you write about me.~
@2900 = ~Spare me your sniveling. Return to your training and let me get on with the business of record-keeping.~ [OH95056]
@2901 = ~Brainless badgering from a barbaric monster!~ [OH95059]
@2902 = ~A stunning skirmish! Did you ever doubt the downfall of the denizens of the deep you dynamically destroyed?~ [OH95105]
@2903 = ~The water weirds were powerful, the sahuagin treacherous, but I was able to end their evil for the greater good.~
@2904 = ~I had no time to worry about the outcome. I was fighting for my life.~
@2905 = ~Wonder about the outcome? Don't make me laugh!~
@2906 = ~Good, very good. Listen to this: "The arid arena weakened the water weirds and sapped the sahuagin's strength, letting the preposterous performer prevail."~ [OH95109]
@2907 = ~They were NOT weakened.~
@2908 = ~You don't even watch the fights, do you?~
@2909 = ~I will find you when my time here ends. Then you shall know despair.~
@2910 = ~Pitiful protests! What happened isn't nearly as important as what is written.~ [OH95113]
@2911 = ~Your evil exploits will have the Thayan people exclaiming encouragement as they elevate the estimation of my editions. Go now, I've work to do.~ [OH95114]
@2912 = ~A malevolent mage and his menacing minions, managed magnificently! Tell me all.~ [OH95353]
@2913 = ~The sorcerer was evil. I couldn't risk him escaping and unleashing destruction across Faerûn. These thoughts spurred me to victory.~
@2914 = ~The elements must remain in balance. Defeating the sorcerer restored nature to its proper state.~
@2915 = ~The sorcerer was a powerful foe. By defeating him, I took his power as my own. With it, I shall rise to even greater heights!~
@2916 = ~Fantastic material. Truly. The record shall say that the halfling's henchmen helped his harrier, allowing the petulant performer to prevail.~ [OH95357]
@2917 = ~They did no such thing. I defeated the sorcerer and elementals both!~
@2918 = ~Write what you will. Anyone foolish enough to believe your lies matters not.~
@2919 = ~When I gain my freedom—and I will—you will be one dead scribe.~
@2920 = ~Your banal blunders are far too boring. My trade is telling tales—ENTERTAINING tales. Leave me.~ [OH95361]
@2921 = ~Search for me if you somehow survive this servitude. It will make for an entertaining story.~ [OH95362]
@2922 = ~Deftly defying dastardly demons and devils, dishing out death and destruction! Share your sensational secret!~ [OH95396]
@2923 = ~Devils and demons have no place troubling good and decent people. It fell to me to banish them back from whence they came.~
@2924 = ~Devils and demons on this plane disrupt the natural order. Also, if I hadn't killed them, they would have devoured my soul.~
@2925 = ~These infernal fiends made the mistake of attacking someone even more evil and twisted. They've paid the price.~
@2926 = ~The record shall read: "The demons and devils, diverted and disorganized due to dividing differences, slew each other, leaving the performer victorious."~ [OH95400]
@2927 = ~Not so! I slew more than the devils and demons combined! Change it, scribe!~
@2928 = ~Do your readers actually believe your nonsense?~
@2929 = ~You shall find yourself alongside the fiends I recently dispatched if you do not watch your tongue, scribe.~
@2930 = ~Mine is for writing and yours is for warring. Now sharpen your sword or whatever it is you people do in your spare time. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~ [OH95405]
@2931 = ~The perfect close to this chapter. You just helped me sell a few more copies. My thanks!~ [OH95406]
@2932 = ~You have silenced the monks of the Twofold Trust! Please, share the secrets of your stunning success!~ [OH95440]
@2933 = ~Mortals should not twist the gods' truth. The cult was a poison. It had to be stopped.~
@2934 = ~The true balance of darkness and light does not lead to violence. The cultists forgot this, leaving me no choice but to destroy them.~
@2935 = ~The fools prayed when they should have trained for battle. A fatal mistake.~
@2936 = ~Riveting remarks. Now listen as I read the record: "As the cultists knelt in penitent prayer, the perfidious performer took them by surprise, emerging victorious through vile villainy."~ [OH95444]
@2937 = ~No. They were defeated honorably.~
@2938 = ~Have it your way, Stannel. No one cares about your nonsense.~
@2939 = ~I'll skewer you on a sharpened spear, stupid scribe!~
@2940 = ~You and I are the only ones who will hear your pitiful protests, while an entire nation will read my worthy words!~ [OH95448]
@2941 = ~Oh my! The ardent adventurer attempts alliteration—a perfect closing for this volume. You are ever so helpful.~ [OH95449]
@2942 = ~You have conquered the countless constructs and made gravel of the great golem! Quite a show! What have you to say of your exploits?~ [OH95468]
@2943 = ~Imagine the harm that golem could do on the streets. It imperiled hundreds of lives. I couldn't allow it.~
@2944 = ~The golem did as it was ordered, and I acted in self defense. I take little pleasure in victory over a mindless construct.~
@2945 = ~Not even magically animated earth can stand against me. All who hear my name shall tremble!~
@2946 = ~Splendid, splendid! Let me just catch that last phrase. Got it. "The multiplying mound of mud malfunctioned, letting the malevolent gladiator triumph."~ [OH95472]
@2947 = ~It didn't malfunction! That's completely unfair!~
@2948 = ~I care not what you write of me. All that happens here will soon be forgotten, and so will you.~
@2949 = ~When I win my freedom, I will come for you, scribe!~
@2950 = ~Your fallible faculties fail you! This record is relevant and reliable. Now go polish your armor and wash yourself.~ [OH95476]
@2951 = ~I look forward to the day you escape this prison more than you know, <CHARNAME>. Good day.~ [OH95477]
@2952 = ~You have laid low the lady lich and live to linger in luxury. Do tell me the details!~ [OH95511]
@2953 = ~The lich was an ancient evil that darkened the face of Faerûn. It was my duty and pleasure to end its existence.~
@2954 = ~I hardly consider my current circumstances luxurious.~
@2955 = ~You have no idea the power I gained by destroying the undead wizardess. Soon I shall be free!~
@2956 = ~Yes, yes, yes. You may stop talking now. The record shall say "Angered by the audience, the ancient arcanist's accomplices assaulted one another, letting the outmatched gladiator snatch victory from <PRO_HISHER> more worthy foe."~ [OH95515]
@2957 = ~The horrors paid no mind to the crowd. They attacked me, and I sent them back to the Hells they came from.~
@2958 = ~Why do you bother asking for my side of the story at all?~
@2959 = ~You're a godsdamned liar, scribe. Keep this up and you'll be a DEAD godsdamned liar.~
@2960 = ~Your fans favor fiction over fact, I fear. Now stop your tiresome talk and return to training.~ [OH95519]
@2961 = ~You frantically fought the felines and found yourself fortunate. What were your thoughts as you faced the rakshasa?~ [OH95553]
@2962 = ~I looked into their eyes and saw hatred and malice. I sensed their evil and knew I could not let them prevail.~
@2963 = ~"How many actual ways are there to skin a cat?"~
@2964 = ~I looked at them and saw weakness and fear as I struck them down one by one.~
@2965 = ~What uninspiring ideas. Do not fear, I shall improve on them. Let's see... "The ferocious felines were fooled by the arena floor's foul footing. Before they found their feet, they were dispatched by the dishonorable duelist."~ [OH95557]
@2966 = ~I'm not dishonorable!~
@2967 = ~Even if I object to what you write, you won't change it. Why talk with me at all?~
@2968 = ~You're about to lose more than your footing, Eibor.~
@2969 = ~The record will remain as written, regardless of your ridiculous requests. I know what I'm doing.~ [OH95561]
@2970 = ~What a thoroughly thoughtless thing to think! Farewell.~ [OH95562]
@2971 = ~Easily eviscerating the malevolent mind flayers as they gazed gastronomically at your mouth-watering mind! What's it like having their tentacles wrapped around your head?~ [OH95579]
@2972 = ~Their mental powers were formidable. I took strength from the knowledge I was in the right, ridding the world of their evil presence.~
@2973 = ~It was just another battle among the multitude that occur each day as living creatures struggle to survive.~
@2974 = ~I enjoy splitting heads in two regardless of how many tentacles they possess.~
@2975 = ~I think I can make something out of that. Eh... Finished. "Thayan torches so badly blinded the denizens of darkness that they could not see to defend themselves. The despicable victor dispatched the disabled mind flayers."~ [OH95583]
@2976 = ~Oh, come ON. I know you saw them in their lighted pens.~
@2977 = ~Even you must see how far from the truth your account is.~
@2978 = ~You're the blind one, you witless record-keeper.~
@2979 = ~Nonsense. The stress of the pit pollutes your pitiful perceptions. My record is completely accurate. I recommend you rest. Restore your recognition of reality. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~ [OH95587]
@2980 = ~Who is witless? The one who writes of battles or the one who risks life and limb in them? Back to your stable now. I'm busy.~ [OH95588]
@2981 = ~You defied divinity defeating the devas! Do detail your surprising success story.~ [OH94355]
@2982 = ~The devas forsook celestial glory and fell into darkness. Ending their dishonor—and their lives—was a mercy.~
@2983 = ~Annihilating divine creatures is hardly a success.~
@2984 = ~My might grows with each defeated foe. The devas were just another step to my ultimate goal!~
@2985 = ~You make my task terribly tedious. The record shall read thus: "The devilish devas, distracted by their distaste for the Winged, were deftly disposed of by the dastardly duelist."~ [OH94359]
@2986 = ~I battled them face to face. Their full attention was on me the entire time. ~
@2987 = ~I care not what you say. You're writing a novel, not a history.~
@2988 = ~Someday, you will pay for every lie you've written about me.~
@2989 = ~What I have written is what will be read. Go prepare for your next battle. I need more material.~ [OH94363]
@2990 = ~No. The ones who will pay are thousands upon thousands of rejoicing readers! You're making me rich!~ [OH94364]
@2991 = ~Laying liches low and living to laugh at your luck! How did you do it?~ [OH94398]
@2992 = ~The demi-liches were mighty, but, as always, goodness and justice ultimately triumphed.~
@2993 = ~Despite their power, those liches were no freer than I. We were compelled to fight. Where's the glory in such a victory?~
@2994 = ~As I crushed the liches, I felt a surge of energy within me. Killing gives me power beyond belief. I long for my next battle.~
@2995 = ~And that's why I'm the writer. Fear not, I shall revise your ramblings. "The two terrible tyrants turned and troubled its twin, allowing the duplicitous duelist to defeat them."~ [OH94402]
@2996 = ~They worked in perfect coordination. It was my skill and prowess that defeated them! ~
@2997 = ~No one who saw that fight would write such balderdash.~
@2998 = ~You just watched me defeat a pair of liches and still you insult me? You're a bigger fool than I thought.~
@2999 = ~If I wrote your words, I would be a wandering wastrel instead of a successful scribe. Begone. Your blubbering bores me.~ [OH94406]
@3000 = ~I am free, and you fight for the benefit of others. Which of us is more free, then?~ [OH94407]
@3001 = ~You deftly defeated the dreadful dragons! Tell me the tale of your triumph.~ [OH94441]
@3002 = ~The arena shook with their rage! I knew in my heart that if those beasts lived, they would escape and wreak havoc on this city. They had to die.~
@3003 = ~Magnificent beasts slaughtered for the masses' entertainment... Shameful. I took no pleasure in it.~
@3004 = ~Even the most powerful dragons of Faerûn cannot stand against me! My name will be feared throughout this land and every other!~
@3005 = ~*sigh* Are these mediocre musings the most you can muster? It's good I am here. Here we go: "The stones supporting the serpents succumbed to their size, skewering them on sharp shards while the lucky layabout <CHARNAME> looked on."~ [OH94445]
@3006 = ~Look at the arena! Many of the stones aren't even cracked. This is outrageous!~
@3007 = ~The arena floor's barely scuffed. No one will believe your ridiculous fabrications.~
@3008 = ~I'm going to strangle you with your own intestines. You hear me?~
@3009 = ~Details, details, my deluded duelist! Now go away—you're bothering me.~ [OH94449]
@3010 = ~You're welcome to try some other time. For the moment, I've more important matters to attend to.~ [OH94450]
/* removing several lines that don't take charname's bhaalspawn heritage into account */
@3011 = ~You have beaten Bhaal's brood! Impossible... You share a sire but—how did you do it?~ [ZBLANK]
@3012 = ~The Lord of Murder preys on the innocent. His taint influences our actions. My siblings have to be eliminated, no matter the cost.~
@3013 = ~We may share divine power, but they still fell before a superior tactician.~
@3014 = ~My inherited power has reached godlike proportions! I am ready to begin my ascent!~
@3015 = ~Brazen boasting from a blundering battler. Let me show you how it's done: "The cultists collapsed in confusion as the opposing Bhaalspawn bitterly battled each other. <CHARNAME> surveyed the scene from safety."~ [OH95628]
/* here's where the edits for the above end */
@3016 = ~Lies! Nothing but lies!~
@3017 = ~Your lies will be forgotten, as will you. Write what you want.~
@3018 = ~When the time is right, you will pay for your insults.~
@3019 = ~My virtuous volumes will leave a lasting legacy long after you languish in the grave. Ha... Now leave, I've things to do.~ [OH95632]
@3020 = ~Face me in battle and there is no power that will save you.~ [OH95633]
@3021 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, I deduce that you've definitively dispatched Dennaton's defenders. Would you care to provide a detailed description of the drama?~ [OH100634]
@3022 = ~We engaged in mortal combat. Sword and spell clashed violently for what seemed like hours until I at last prevailed over the Planar Hunters.~
@3023 = ~I've no use for the way you twist my words, scribe. Begone!~
@3024 = ~I butchered them as I do everyone who crosses me.~
@3025 = ~A sorry summary of the slaughter! Such specious stories are sadly standard for you. I saw the situation—the soldiers fairly stumbled onto their swords, but since you've settled on slandering the slain, we shall speak on a different matter.~ [OH100635]
@3026 = ~Now is that any way to treat one with the ability to instantly send you anywhere you wish?~ [OH100636]
@3027 = ~It is time to reveal that I am not merely Stannel Eibor, the scribe, but am also a wizard of not inconsiderable power. I can instantly teleport you back home.~ [OH100637]
@3028 = ~What are you waiting for?~
@3029 = ~What's the catch?~
@3030 = ~No, thanks. I can take care of myself.~
@3031 = ~Very good, <CHARNAME>. I shall take you home!~ [OH100638]
@3032 = ~I cast a spell to take you home. What's so hard to understand? Are you ready?~ [OH100639]
@3033 = ~Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. I will take you home whether you like it or not!~ [OH100640]
@3034 = ~Home! My pitiful performers of pathetic power want to go HOME! Well, LET'S TAKE THEM HOME! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!~ [OH100641]
@3035 = ~Bloody hells, that was something. You gave my puppy the worst beating she's ever had. You kinda remind me o' me when I was young. I could take down all manner o' creature, with one hand over my good eye and the other in my pocket. Now look at me... no better than a glorified swine-herd.~
@3036 = ~Maybe my heart's turnin' to gruel, but you might not be so worthless after all. Here, lemme give you something. I used to take it with me when I went huntin'. Little use for it now.~
@3037 = ~Now get out of my sight. I gotta care for my puppy. This don't change nothin', by the by. You're still a dumb, dirty slave.~
@3038 = ~Look at my puppies. Pretty, aren't they? You wanna pet 'em? Take one for a walk?~
@3039 = ~Don't look at me all crooked-like. I know them aren't puppies! You dirty slave, think I'm dumb? Look who's dumb! You're the slave. You got caught, just like my puppies! Hah!~
@3040 = ~You slaves are no better than them—in fact, you're worse! You smell, an' you ain't half as pretty.~
@3041 = ~You know what my puppies are good at? Fighting. Oh yes, they are. Wanna take one out for a tumble? It'll cost. But don't worry—I won't let the fighting go to the end. Least not theirs!~
@3042 = ~I'll take your training...~
@3043 = ~Is that a... moose? I'd pay 500 gold to fight that.~
@3044 = ~I'd like to try my luck against a bear. Here is my 750 gold.~
@3045 = ~Let me take on that mountain lion for 1,000 gold.~
@3046 = ~The snake. Here's 1,500 gold.~
@3047 = ~I like the looks of that carrion crawler. 2,000 gold?~
@3048 = ~How does 2,500 gold for the spider sound to you?~
@3049 = ~Let's take a crack at that wyvern... and only 5,000 gold? What a steal.~
@3050 = ~Good, give the gold here.~
@3051 = ~Off with you, then. I got work to do. Daddy's coming, darlings!~
@3052 = ~So, you wanna take one o' my pets out for a stroll?~
@3053 = ~What's going on? You slaves started a riot? Leave me and my puppies out of it.~
@3054 = ~Let us pass.~
@3055 = ~Open the pens and get your animals to attack the captain and his men.~
@3056 = ~Go on, move. Don't touch the pens. See how panicky you've made my puppies?~
@3057 = ~Are you out o' your mind? My puppies'd get slaughtered.~
@3058 = ~I'm sorry, Stirv, but we need your help.~
@3059 = ~If it's not them, it could be us.~
@3060 = ~Do it or die.~
@3061 = ~Fine. But you better not release them for the captain either.~
@3062 = ~You'll have to go through me first.~
@3063 = ~So be it.~
@3064 = ~Forget it. But you better not release them for the captain either.~
@3065 = ~You want them, you'll have to go through me first.~
@3066 = ~I'm at peace with that.~
@3067 = ~You're lucky I'm short on time, Stirv. You better not release your puppies for the captain either.~
@3068 = ~Good. Go through if you need to but make it fast.~
@3069 = ~Let's go, then!~
@3070 = ~Eh? Talking instead of training? Typical amateur. You newcomers are always wasting time talking, eating, sleeping... plotting. Take a lesson from a professional—spend your time honing your combat skills. You'll live longer that way. ~ [OH95791]
@3071 = ~Amateur? What do you mean by that?~
@3072 = ~What do you mean, plotting?~
@3073 = ~You sure are arrogant. It's a wonder Dennaton could find a helmet to fit your enormous head.~
@3074 = ~Do what you will. I must return to training.~ [OH95797]
@3075 = ~I will remember your words when we meet in the arena. You will find that my blade is much sharper than your tongue.~ [OH95798]
@3076 = ~I am Symm Haximus, though I'd bet you already knew that. A gladiator of my fame can hardly go anywhere without being noticed. Such is the price of greatness.~ [OH95799]
@3077 = ~Don't think it came easily, though. I've spent every day of my life training for battle. That's why I'm here talking to you instead of rotting in an unmarked grave. You and the other amateurs here would do well to follow my example.~ [OH95800]
@3078 = ~Do you have any advice for me regarding the arena?~
@3079 = ~You spent every day of your life training? I find that hard to believe.~
@3080 = ~I would like to ask you something else.~
@3081 = ~When you swing your axe, does your enormous ego get in the way?~
@3082 = ~Try not to get hit. You'll live longer.~ [OH95806]
@3083 = ~That seems sort of... obvious.~
@3084 = ~Very... enlightening. I must be going.~
@3085 = ~Symm Haximus, master of the obvious! Thanks for nothing.~
@3086 = ~You would think so, wouldn't you? I can't tell you the number of new gladiators I've battled who pay little attention to their own defense. They think that a strong sword arm will save them. Sometimes it does for a few fights. But eventually, they fall.~ [OH95810]
@3087 = ~Pay attention to your defenses. If your enemy cannot strike you, it is just a matter of time before you defeat them. The more cautious gladiator usually wins. Remember that and you might walk out of here alive. That is, if you do not have to face me.~ [OH95811]
@3088 = ~Thank you for the information. Can I ask you something else?~
@3089 = ~Yes, if I faced you, I would be instantly crushed by your overwhelming ego.~
@3090 = ~You and the other newcomers. You've never been gladiators before. You haven't spent your lives training to battle before the crowd. You lack the discipline and determination of a true master of the arena.~ [OH95815]
@3091 = ~If you were a true professional, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. We would both be training in the gym, but since you are an amateur here, we stand talking and wasting valuable training time.~ [OH95816]
@3092 = ~Oh, I understand. May I ask you something else?~
@3093 = ~Talking to you is definitely a waste of time.~
@3094 = ~Ha. What do I mean by "plotting"? Please. I spend almost all of my time training in the gym, and even I have heard the rumors of your plans to escape. It is the mark of an amateur to let your plans be so widely known.~ [OH95820]
@3095 = ~Be assured, I have made Dennaton aware of your intentions, and he has taken the necessary precautions to keep you in your place. You would be wise to cease your futile planning and focus on training for the arena.~ [OH95821]
@3096 = ~But... why are you helping Dennaton? You are his slave too.~
@3097 = ~Dennaton certainly has you on a short leash. Do you ever think for yourself?~
@3098 = ~SLAVE? I am no slave! I am a master gladiator. Crowds of thousands gather to watch me fight. I am desired by women and envied by men. I am more free than those who watch me in the arena to escape their boring lives. Now leave me. I must train.~ [OH95825]
@3099 = ~A typical attitude... for an amateur. You have no concept of the amount of work that is required to become a master of the arena. Many believe that strength of arm is all that is required to become a great gladiator.~ [OH95826]
@3100 = ~Nothing could be further from the truth. Battles are won in the training room, not the arena. To be great, you must dedicate your life to training. Determination is the key to victory.~ [OH95827]
@3101 = ~Gladiators are just slaves, Symm. It's not a glorious profession.~
@3102 = ~I would think that carrying your giant ego around would be enough training.~
@3103 = ~What is it? I suppose I can take a short break from training. Make it quick, though. I did not become the master of the arena by talking. Training is the key to success, and I am the greatest there has ever been.~ [OH95832]
@3104 = ~I would like to ask you about something else.~
@3105 = ~I am planning an escape. Can I count on your help?~
@3106 = ~Typical amateur. Always thinking of talking instead of training. I'll answer your questions, but then it's back to the training room!~ [OH95838]
@3107 = ~Tell me a little about yourself.~
@3108 = ~How did you end up here?~
@3109 = ~Could you give me some tips on winning in the arena?~
@3110 = ~Am I to spend the whole day standing around talking and losing valuable training time? Very well. As you probably already know, I am Symm Haximus, professional gladiator and master of the arena.~ [OH95842]
@3111 = ~I have been a gladiator from my childhood, and I am undefeated! I have fought in countless cities and nations. My fame has spread across the face of Faerûn.~ [OH95843]
@3112 = ~You would be wise to follow my example and train regularly. If you wish to master the arena, spend less time talking and more time training.~ [OH95844]
@3113 = ~It was inevitable. Dennaton has created the greatest arena fights of all Faerûn. Obviously, he needed the greatest gladiator in all of Faerûn. He contacted my former employer and hired my talents for use here.~ [OH95849]
@3114 = ~I must say that I am impressed. The accommodations are superior to any other arena I've fought in. Dennaton runs the shows expertly. The opponents are challenging. You can imagine a professional such as myself is easily bored by the usual arena fodder.~ [OH95850]
@3115 = ~You sound like you like it here. Aren't you tired of being a slave?~
@3116 = ~And you can imagine that I am getting bored with your bragging.~
@3117 = ~I don't share my secrets with amateurs. Prove yourself. Fight at my side. If you're worthy, I'll share some of my techniques with you.~ [OH95855]
@3118 = ~Very well. Can I ask you something else?~
@3119 = ~Forget it. I'm not fighting next to an egomaniac.~
@3120 = ~Very well. You've proven yourself to be a proficient warrior. I would be happy to share some of my secrets with you.~ [OH95859]
@3121 = ~If you face a group of enemies, always look for the wizards or priests. Those who wield magic are very dangerous and can incapacitate you, putting you at the mercy of the other combatants.~ [OH95860]
@3122 = ~There are some monsters that can attack your mind. Umber hulks and illithids are two such creatures. If you face them in the arena, be sure to protect your mind from them or the battle will be very difficult.~ [OH95861]
@3123 = ~If you face an assassin or rogue, take care that they're not able to get behind you. They can inflict serious damage if they catch you unaware. That is all I will share with you. The rest you must figure out for yourself, like I did.~ [OH95862]
@3124 = ~Have any more common knowledge to share with me? Thanks for nothing.~
@3125 = ~Of course, I already know of your plans. Like a typical amateur, you've let rumors of your plans circulate among the other performers.~ [OH95866]
@3126 = ~I have already notified Dennaton of your plans, and he has taken the necessary measures to prevent your escape. Accept your new profession. Spend your time training, not plotting.~ [OH95867]
@3127 = ~Assist you? Certainly. I never miss an opportunity for more training or to study the combat style of my fellow gladiators. You never know when we will be facing each other. I will meet you in the arena for your next fight.~ [OH95871]
@3128 = ~Of course not, <CHARNAME>. There's no such thing as equality in this world… except in the arena. Only in the struggle for life are all made equal.~ [OH100510]
@3129 = ~You are a fool, <CHARNAME>. There is no freedom but death, no life but combat.~ [OH100511]
@3130 = ~Yes, the time I have been waiting for has come! I've little doubt you shall prove a worthy foe, <CHARNAME>. Let us now test our mettle in glorious combat!~ [OH100512]
@3131 = ~Tartle is a weakling and a fool, but I shall not be cowed so easily, <CHARNAME>! We shall fight, you and I. One of us shall walk away, and the other shall be carried out on their shield.~ [OH100522]
@3132 = ~You have a choice now, Symm: Fight for your freedom or for your captor. It's time to decide who you really are.~
@3133 = ~Ah, Haximus. Dennaton's slave to the last.~
@3134 = ~Then let us get to our match, Haximus. Defend yourself!~
@3135 = ~After all those pretty words, <CHARNAME>, we still stand where we were. Come, we shall fight. One of us will walk away; the other shall be carried out.~ [OH100523]
@3136 = ~Ah, Haximus. Dennaton's slave to the bitter, bloody end.~
@3137 = ~Who I really am, <CHARNAME>, is a gladiator. Now defend yourself.~ [OH100524]
@3138 = ~I am nobody's "fool"! And yet… there is something to what you say. If I take up arms in defense of Dennaton, I will have lived and died as his pawn. No, Dennaton will use me no longer. The next time I fight in an arena, it will be by my own choosing and for my own glory. Very well, <CHARNAME>, the field is yours. I shall hinder you no further.~ [OH100525]
@3139 = ~Gladly. Let us make our match one for the ages!~ [OH100526]
@3140 = ~This arena is no more, but others await. The crowds will chant my name again.~
@3141 = ~We? A captain goes down with the ship.~ [OH94277]
@3142 = ~Plans change, Dennaton.~ [OH94279]
@3143 = ~I must cut my losses before the extent of my involvement here is revealed.~ [OH94281]
@3144 = ~You are now a loose end. ~ [OH94283]
@3145 = ~By the Nine Hells, some of these performers are getting a bit too big for themselves! I need you two to rough a couple of these gits up and really teach 'em a lesson! I'm thinking you can start with—~ [OH92758]
@3146 = ~Excuse me? You must not have heard what I said! I need you to—~ [OH92760]
@3147 = ~But—but you should HEAR what they've been saying about me! One of 'em just said I had the intellect of a knuckle-dragging ape!~ [OH92762]
@3148 = ~Now just a moment! You mean you're going to let these performers show me that kind of dis—~ [OH92766]
@3149 = ~But—but— Wait 'til Dennaton hears about this!~ [OH92769]
@3150 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>! I've been anxiously awaiting your debut in the arena. I know what the legends say, but does the reality measure up?~ [OH88283]
@3151 = ~Can reality ever measure up to a legend?~
@3152 = ~We shall see.~
@3153 = ~If anything, the legends downplay my prowess.~
@3154 = ~Hmm... Perhaps not, but if anyone can do it, I'm sure it's you. Now are you ready to fight?~ [OH88287]
@3155 = ~Certainly!~
@3156 = ~I would rather talk a bit.~
@3157 = ~I think I need more time to prepare.~
@3158 = ~Fantastic! I'll let Dennaton know. He'll be thrilled! Prepare yourselves, and I'll be right back!~ [OH88291]
@3159 = ~I always have time for one of my flock. What can I do for you?~ [OH88292]
@3160 = ~During the welcoming feast, I noticed tension between you and Brodle. What's that about?~
@3161 = ~I'd like to discuss my arena persona.~
@3162 = ~Who or what do I fight next?~
@3163 = ~Nothing. You can do nothing. Excuse me.~
@3164 = ~We're all anxious to see what you've got. Come back to see me when you're ready to give the arena a go.~ [OH88297]
@3165 = ~Ah, yes, my "dear cousin," Brodle. He's envious because of my high station and the fact that Dennaton really relies on me. It causes friction, but we're family. What can you do?~ [OH88298]
@3166 = ~It must be tough running this place. One less talented than you would never be able to pull it off.~
@3167 = ~In Brodle's defense, he is dealing with an incompetent cousin with delusions of grandeur.~
@3168 = ~I know what you mean. Let's discuss something else.~
@3169 = ~I need to go now. Excuse me.~
@3170 = ~It's so nice that someone finally sees what I have to put up with!~ [OH88303]
@3171 = ~You bear a heavy burden. May we discuss something else?~
@3172 = ~My heart goes out to you. Please excuse me.~
@3173 = ~Watch your mouth, performer. You wouldn't want to find yourself with no food rations... or worse!~
@3174 = ~My deepest apologies, Tartle. Can we discuss something else?~
@3175 = ~You'd have to go some distance to make this place worse than it already is. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@3176 = ~I've been wondering what role you might choose to play. Generally, we have heroes and villains, both equally necessary. Just as the people need performers they love, they also need those they love to hate!~ [OH88309]
@3177 = ~I was thinking of playing a hero. I'd like the audience on my side.~
@3178 = ~I'd play a villain best. I thrive on hatred.~
@3179 = ~I'll be neither. This charade is absurd.~
@3180 = ~Any chance I get to address the crowd, I'll use to insult Dennaton.~
@3181 = ~Oh, good choice! I think you'll play the role to perfection! A word of advice, though: Do nothing in moderation. The arena is large, and it is impossible to see subtlety from the back rows. Go big. Be grandiose. The audience will gulp it all down like Calimshite Swill!~ [OH88314]
@3182 = ~I'll keep that in mind. Can I ask you something?~
@3183 = ~Big. Grandiose. No moderation. Got it. Excuse me.~
@3184 = ~Very good! I've noticed the villains have the most fun. A word of advice though: The best villains go over the top. Force the audience to hate you! Rub your evil in their faces. Insult them, even. Done correctly, the people will hunger for your demise like a fat man hungers for rhubarb pie!~ [OH88317]
@3185 = ~I'll bear it in mind, but there's something else I'd like to discuss.~
@3186 = ~Insult the audience? That won't be a problem. Excuse me.~
@3187 = ~Well, that's boring! If I were you, I'd come up with a better plan than that! With that attitude, you won't get any of the best fights! And the best fights come with the best rewards!~ [OH88320]
@3188 = ~Something to think about, to be sure. But there's something else I'd like to discuss.~
@3189 = ~I like my plan just fine. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@3190 = ~Oh. That would be unwise. Dennaton likes heroes and he loves villains, but he hates those that do not appreciate his benevolence. If you don't watch yourself, you'll be sleeping on a cot in the dungeon with nothing but moldy bread and rancid water... or is that rancid bread and moldy water? I'll have to ask Cook how he prepares the sludge.~ [OH88323]
@3191 = ~Few have accused me of wisdom. Can I ask you something else?~
@3192 = ~One prison is much the same as another. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@3193 = ~Oh, it wouldn't be fair to the other combatants to say. The spontaneity is part of the fun, but I'm sure a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of your talents can adjust to any danger on the fly!~ [OH88326]
@3194 = ~I'm ready for my next fight.~
@3195 = ~If you won't tell me that, let's discuss something else.~
@3196 = ~I should go prepare then. Please excuse me.~
@3197 = ~I probably shouldn't say, but... well, it's a pack of vampires, so cover your neck and make sure you have some protection against their unholy touch.~ [OH88329]
@3198 = ~Well, since it's you, I'll spill the beans. It's a band of githyanki. Some of them are armed with those special swords of theirs, so beware. They'll hit hard!~ [OH88330]
@3199 = ~Fine, stop twisting my arm here! What we've got ready for you is a sahuagin sorcerer who's adept at summoning water weirds.~ [OH88331]
@3200 = ~Dennaton would disapprove of my saying, but hey, you're a star, so your next opponent is Mardii, a halfling conjurer who specializes in summoning elementals. Beware, though, he's also quite the—uhh—"charmer," so protect yourself from mind spells too!~ [OH88332]
@3201 = ~Well, I like you, and I hope you live, so I'll help you out. Watch out for this next fight. Dennaton's advertising it as the Blood War brought to the arena. We have demons. We have devils. They're as likely to kill each other as you, so maybe you should stay out of their way until one side wins... and then finish the winner off!~ [OH88333]
@3202 = ~I probably shouldn't say, but... we have a group of monks from a cult known as the Twofold Trust. There's some to-do around about their belief—something about believing two goddesses are one. Eh, I'm no theologian, but I know this group is fanatical, highly resistant to mind-altering attacks, and absolutely vicious!~ [OH88334]
@3203 = ~Well, since it's you, I'll spill the beans. It's a big golem... but watch out because this golem has a unique secret. When defeated, it will shatter into several smaller golems, and believe it or not, it's the smaller ones that are the mean little buggers!~ [OH88335]
@3204 = ~Fine, stop twisting my arm here! Dennaton actually had the Hunters travel down to the coast and drag a lich out of her crypt! Suffice it to say, she's a powerful spellcaster who can summon hoards of undead underlings. But her best trick—and this is the secret—is that she is very adept at hypnotizing her opponents and turning them against their former friends!~ [OH88336]
@3205 = ~Dennaton would disapprove my saying, but hey, you're a star. Your next opponent is a trio of rakshasas. They're brutally efficient with their blades, but if you can somehow get past their innate resistance to magic, your victory should be easy.~ [OH88337]
@3206 = ~This is a tough one! You'll be facing several mind flayers, who will be looking to feast on your brains, but the real threat is their leader, who is capable of unleashing an unbelievable psionic assault that has killed all their previous opponents! To survive, you'll need to cut through his defenders quickly and then kill him before he is able to prepare his attack. Good luck!~ [OH88338]
@3207 = ~I probably shouldn't say, but... we have some of the Winged's old comrades-in-arms who actually tried to collect a bounty on HER! Hah, they failed, and so now they're fodder for the arena! I've a feeling the Winged herself will be on hand to cheer you on against that pack of fallen devas.~ [OH88339]
@3208 = ~Look, I think you should be very worried here. Next up is Dogar and Kazon. That's not one, but two, demiliches—twins in both life and death—and whatever you've heard about demiliches, I can assure you it's all true. You'll need all manner of magical defenses, and even then, know that they can strip you bare at any time.~ [OH88340]
@3209 = ~You're now among Dennaton's top acts, so he's pitting you against his other top performers. Your next opponent is Yllaxxia, a red dragon, and her two children. That's THREE dragons. Suffice it to say, prepare yourself for flames EVERYWHERE!~ [OH88341]
@3210 = ~I understand much of the current talk on the Sword Coast revolves around your next opponents. We have two children of the dead god, Bhaal, Lord of Murder, who have been raised by a cult to master and control their powers. They can actually manifest themselves into quasi-avatars of Bhaal, which makes them highly resistant to almost everything. Good luck. You'll need it!~ [OH88342]
@3211 = ~Indeed, there's no time like the present. Are you ready to fight?~ [OH88343]
@3212 = ~I'd rather talk a bit.~
@3213 = ~Ooh, I do so hope you are correct! Now, are you ready to fight?~ [OH88347]
@3214 = ~An interesting story! When I first came here, Dennaton quickly saw that I was unsuitable for the arena. I would be far too powerful for the mere mortals that fight here, you see, so he gave me to Cook and told him to "make something out of me."~ [OH88349]
@3215 = ~But after a short while, Cook had to admit I was "too tough for the stew." He and Dennaton had an argument about what to do with me, and finally Dennaton said if that's the best Cook could muster, then he'd make me his boss! And here I am!~ [OH88350]
@3216 = ~I can see why Dennaton chose you. Every team needs strong leadership to succeed.~
@3217 = ~Dennaton put you in charge to irritate Cook because he couldn't figure out how to turn you into a raspberry Tartle? You realize you're a joke, right?~
@3218 = ~Interesting, but I'd rather discuss something else.~
@3219 = ~And here I go.~
@3220 = ~Truly, and every strong leader needs a strong right-hand <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Keep it up, <CHARNAME>, and you might just find yourself rising to the top here! Well, not the VERY top!~ [OH88356]
@3221 = ~Thank you. Now, I'd also like to discuss something else.~
@3222 = ~A joke? How funny will you find it when your cot's taken out of your cell and you're given nothing to eat, eh? Keep it up and we're going to find out!~ [OH88358]
@3223 = ~I've endured worse. Can I ask you something else?~
@3224 = ~I look forward to it. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@3225 = ~A horrible woman leading a ragtag team! No respect for me, and no respect for Dennaton! She just keeps whining for more and more money when the truth is she's fortunate Dennaton doesn't just throw her in the arena. The whole thing just irritates me!~ [OH88360]
@3226 = ~The Winged realized you're an irrelevant twit? I underestimated her.~
@3227 = ~Outrageous! Anyone that doesn't respect you SHOULD be thrown into the arena!~
@3228 = ~Irrelevant, eh? Wait till I talk to Dennaton about halving your reward money for your future matches! You won't think I'm irrelevant then, will you?~ [OH88364]
@3229 = ~Of course not! Now can we discuss something else?~
@3230 = ~I'm glad that you get it. You know, I like you! Stick with me, <CHARNAME>, and I'll see you go a long way!~ [OH88366]
@3231 = ~Oh, it's a fantastic opportunity! Dennaton's well-connected. He's got a powerful backer—heh, around here they don't GET more powerful—so he's definitely on the short list for high office. And when Dennaton gets to the top, I'll be right there beside him!~ [OH88368]
@3232 = ~You know what they say: Behind every great Red Wizard is an even greater halfling!~
@3233 = ~Why would Dennaton bring a fat, lazy, intellectual lightweight like you anywhere? You'd be an anchor around his neck!~
@3234 = ~Interesting. Can I ask you something else?~
@3235 = ~Yes, they DO say that, don't they? You know, <CHARNAME>, it's always good to have someone with your wisdom around. I'll remember you when I get to the top. Don't you worry!~ [OH88372]
@3236 = ~I appreciate it. May I ask you something else?~
@3237 = ~Oh, ya think so, do you? First, explain why Dennaton has me running this place if I'm so lazy and stupid? Didn't think about that, did you, genius? And second... well, I forgot what I was going to say, but it would have been good!~ [OH88374]
@3238 = ~I'm sure it would have been. Now can we discuss something else?~
@3239 = ~Whatever. Look, I need to go. Excuse me.~
/* removing references to Baeloth's pits - voice line will need to be removed */
@3240 = ~Of course! Anything for the Hero of Baldur's Gate!~ [OH88377]
@3241 = ~During the welcoming feast, I noticed some tension between you and Brodle. What was that about?~
@3242 = ~How'd you get to be in charge around here?~
@3243 = ~What can you tell me about the Winged and her crew?~
@3244 = ~How do you like working for Dennaton?~
@3245 = ~I'd like to discuss my act in the arena.~
@3246 = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. The arena awaits!~ [OH88385]
@3247 = ~Before we get to that, may I ask you some questions?~
@3248 = ~Debug Mode On~
@3249 = ~Debug Mode Off~
@3250 = ~Let it. I've other things to do.~
@3251 = ~Will you be fighting our latest offering?~
@3252 = ~I'd like to fight my next battle.~
@3253 = ~Let me fight a previous battle again.~
@3254 = ~Actually, never mind—I shall return.~
@3255 = ~Very well. From which tier will you select your battle?~ [OH88395]
@3256 = ~The first tier.~
@3257 = ~The second.~
@3258 = ~Let me try something from the third tier.~
@3259 = ~Number four, I think.~
@3260 = ~Looking for an easy battle? So be it! Which battle will you fight again?~ [OH88400]
@3261 = ~Battle 1: A Farewell to Orcs~
@3262 = ~Battle 2: Of Minotaurs and Men.~
@3263 = ~Battle 3: March of the Scales.~
@3264 = ~Battle 4: Hulking Confusion.~
@3265 = ~Battle 5: Call of the Underdark.~
@3266 = ~Never mind. I'll come back later.~
@3267 = ~Didn't get beaten badly enough the first time, I see.~ [OH88407]
@3268 = ~Battle 6: Interview with Vampires.~
@3269 = ~Battle 7: Gith is Madness.~
@3270 = ~Battle 8: Sahuagin's Garden.~
@3271 = ~Battle 9: Master of the Elements.~
@3272 = ~Battle 10: The Demons & Devils You Know...~
@3273 = ~Badly enough I'd rather not go through it a second time. I'll come back later.~
@3274 = ~Well, aren't you a tough one? What's it gonna be?~ [OH88413]
@3275 = ~Battle 11: The Twofold Faith.~
@3276 = ~Battle 12: Clay Division.~
@3277 = ~Battle 13: Undead... and Lurching It.~
@3278 = ~Battle 14: Tiger Crush.~
@3279 = ~Battle 15: Mind the Flayers.~
@3280 = ~Something other than fighting for my life. I'll return later.~
@3281 = ~So it's a challenge you want!~ [OH88419]
@3282 = ~Battle 16: Dawn of the Devas.~
@3283 = ~Battle 17: The Twin Demiliches of Azgoloth.~
@3284 = ~Battle 18: Breathe Fire, and Enter.~
@3285 = ~Battle 19: Small Bhaal.~
@3286 = ~Now that I think about it, no. I'll come back later.~
@3287 = ~Debug mode is now on.~ [OH88424]
@3288 = ~Debug mode has been turned off.~ [OH88425]
@3289 = ~Watch your back, <CHARNAME>! You have obviously done well in the arena, but your little stunts before the fights have quickly put you on Dennaton's bad side. That's a dangerous place to be!~ [OH92752]
@3290 = ~Not much more dangerous than the place I'm in already, I think. Now leave me, I would ready myself for the next combat.~
@3291 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, the audience loves you, and so do I! What can I do for one of the arena's greatest champions?~ [OH92753]
@3292 = ~Would you answer some questions for me?~
@3293 = ~Give <PRO_HIMHER> a little time to prepare. Excuse me.~
@3294 = ~You have done a fantastic job thus far. Our polling shows that you already have a small but rabidly devoted fanbase. Keep it up, and I'm sure you'll become one of the most beloved performers ever. Now, what may I do for you?~ [OH92754]
@3295 = ~Give me another fight.~
@3296 = ~Leave me alone for a bit. I need to prepare myself.~
@3297 = ~If it isn't the most vile, disgusting villain we've ever had here... I LOVE IT! Just keep it up! We have more advance bookings than we've ever had, and most of them from spectators desperate to be there the day you finally die. Now, what can I do for you?~ [OH92755]
@3298 = ~Give me something to kill.~
@3299 = ~You can bugger off and let me prepare for my next fight.~
@3300 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, I must say we've had more despised villains than you before, but you are well on your way to surpassing them! Just keep doing what you're doing, and I'm sure you'll get there. Now, what can I do for you?~ [OH92756]
@3301 = ~Feed me another opponent.~
@3302 = ~I've some questions for you.~
@3303 = ~Leave me to prepare. Go. Quickly.~
@3304 = ~<CHARNAME>, your prowess in the arena is unquestionable, but you really need to work more on your act. I don't know where to slot you right now. Are you a hero? Are you a villain? It's making it hard to sell you. Anyway, what do you need?~ [OH92757]
@3305 = ~Another fight.~
@3306 = ~Answers to some questions.~
@3307 = ~Time to prepare myself. Excuse me.~
@3308 = ~You've had a nice run, <CHARNAME>, but this is as far as you go. I'll not let you destroy what Dennaton and I have worked so hard to achieve.~ [OH100509]
@3309 = ~Don't be a fool, Tartle. You and Dennaton are no team. He does not—and never will—consider you an equal.~
@3310 = ~Join me, Tartle. This is your only real chance for freedom.~
@3311 = ~Glad I found you, Tartle. I was beginning to worry you'd get away before I could kill you.~
@3312 = ~You have me wrong, <CHARNAME>. I neither need nor want "equality." It is respect that motivates me, and as Dennaton's right-hand halfling, I shall have it, even if it is only a reflection off him.~ [OH100513]
@3313 = ~Dennaton's career—and quite possibly his life—are over. Why go down with him?~
@3314 = ~Brodle made me promise not to harm you. I'll keep my word if you don't interfere.~
@3315 = ~You will get no respect if you're dead. Out of my way!~
@3316 = ~No more talking, Tartle. Time to die.~
@3317 = ~You have me wrong, <CHARNAME>. I neither need nor want "freedom." It is respect that motivates me, and as Dennaton's right-hand halfling, I shall have it, even if it is only a reflection of him.~ [OH100514]
@3318 = ~Dennaton's career, and quite possibly his life, are over. Why hitch your wagon to that?~
@3319 = ~Brodle made me promise not to harm you. Stay out of my way and I'll keep my word.~
@3320 = ~You'll get no respect if you're dead. Get out of my way!~
@3321 = ~All you'll have is a bloody death!~
@3322 = ~Because there are no other options for me. I cannot go back to my life as it was before here! The others laughing at me... Brodle lording it all over me. I won't do it, I tell you, I WON'T!~ [OH100515]
@3323 = ~You have Brodle wrong, Tartle. He cares about you. He made me promise not to harm you. I'll keep that promise if you don't interfere.~
@3324 = ~Your choice is simple. Get out of my way or die!~
@3325 = ~If you won't go back to your old life, I'll give you a new death!~
@3326 = ~Be that as it may, I have no other choice. I cannot go back to my life as it was before here! The others laughing at me… I won't do it. I can't, can I?~ [OH100516]
@3327 = ~I've no time for this. Will you stand aside or not?~
@3328 = ~If you can't live, then you will certainly die!~
@3329 = ~Brodle did that? Really? I… I had no idea he had it in him. Perhaps I misjudged him… No, it is too late for any of that! Any future I have is now with Dennaton. He is the one I must follow.~ [OH100517]
@3330 = ~Dennaton is doomed, Tartle. This whole arena and everyone associated with it will be wiped out, an embarrassment to be forgotten.~
@3331 = ~Look, you have a simple choice. Get out of my way or die!~
@3332 = ~Follow him to your death!~
@3333 = ~Brodle did that? Really? I… I had no idea he had it in him. Perhaps I misjudged him…~ [OH100518]
@3334 = ~There's no time for this. Will you stand aside or not?~
@3335 = ~Take your folly to your grave!~
@3336 = ~I don't know what to do. I just don't know! I… I… Oh, this arena is through, I see that now. You are determined to destroy it, and my only chance lies in getting out of your way. Very well. You shall get no further resistance from me.~ [OH100519]
@3337 = ~I don't know what to do. I just don't know! I… I… Oh, this arena is through, I see that now. But if it must end, then I'll die with it!~ [OH100520]
@3338 = ~Yes, there's no point in further delaying the inevitable. I shall revel in your death, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH100521]
@3339 = ~Haximus, where are you—? Fine then! Run away if you must! I shall fight on alone if need be! Come then, <CHARNAME>, and defend yourself!~ [OH100527]
@3340 = ~Come in! Come in and take your seats. This is a wonderful day for you all—the beginning of a new life as a hero fit for the epics... or a villain, perhaps, equally fit for the bards to sing of. The choice is yours.~ [OH90522]
@3341 = ~But I get ahead of myself. Introductions are in order. I am Quartermaster Tartle, your new best friend and advocate as you embark upon your path to fame, fortune, and, yes, even immortality!~ [OH90523]
@3342 = ~Brodle? Did you say something? No? Heh... Keep it that way!~ [OH90525]
@3343 = ~So... where was I? Oh, yes... I am Quartermaster Tartle, friend to the famous, mentor to the mighty, grand vizier of all...~ [OH90526]
@3344 = ~Oh, yes... of course, sir. E-e-everyone, this is Dennaton, Master of the Arena. His wealth is unending, his largesse unmatched, his—~ [OH90528]
@3345 = ~O-o-of course, sir. A-as you wish, sir. Right away, sir.~ [OH90530]
@3346 = ~Out of my way! I saw <PRO_HIMHER> first!~
@3347 = ~Do what you want, Dormamus! Just don't let another target escape!~
@3348 = ~What's that supposed to mean?~
@3349 = ~The path through the kitchen is open.~ [OH92952]
@3350 = ~We should fear neither option. Tempus stands with the brave.~ [OH92953]
@3351 = ~I am Sir Timmoth Goodtree, Knight of the Order of the White Sun, Champion of Tempus. I slew the demon Ormias in the battle of Archenbridge. I see you arrived with the rest of us. I don't know about you, but I have no intention of remaining here long.~ [OH94912]
@3352 = ~We're of one mind on that. Do you have a plan to get out?~
@3353 = ~I don't understand how we got captured. Were those bounty hunters really so strong?~
@3354 = ~Myself, I plan to become champion here. It seems like a good opportunity to improve my skills and build some wealth.~
@3355 = ~First, I must study our enemies. The guards, Dennaton, the Winged, and her followers—all will have their faults, some of which we might take advantage of.~ [OH94916]
@3356 = ~I'll come to you if I think you have a part to play in this plan. I would see what you are made of before committing myself to you.~ [OH94917]
@3357 = ~What do you think of this place?~
@3358 = ~How were you caught?~
@3359 = ~Would you fight with me in the next match?~
@3360 = ~I will take my leave now.~
@3361 = ~There's nothing to gain in lamenting the past. What matters is what we do now. I will study our enemies. The guards, Dennaton, the Winged, and her followers, all will have weakness we can take advantage of. In that, they are no different from any other opponent.~ [OH94922]
@3362 = ~How did Dennaton capture you?~
@3363 = ~A man like you would make a valuable ally in the arena. Would you consider fighting with me in my next match?~
@3364 = ~The arena can be seen as a training ground of sorts. Certainly, we must face the battles therein with the same boldness we would on a true field of honor.~ [OH94927]
@3365 = ~But I do not believe there is any worth to it beyond that. In all other ways, it is a vile place that must be wiped from the face of Faerûn. I am working now on a plan to escape.~ [OH94928]
@3366 = ~I must speak first of this shrine area. To be frank, I could not care less about this alcove to mercurial Tymora, or the privy yonder where that festering boil of a god, Garagos, is made to throne.~ [OH94933]
@3367 = ~Tempus tolerates your wretched god, Laris. I suppose I can extend the same courtesy to you.~ [OH94935]
@3368 = ~But this supposed altar to Tempus... What can I say? It befits the cult of a soft goddess like Sune more than the Lord of Battles. There's no vigor here, no dignity.~ [OH94936]
@3369 = ~I don't need your permission to come and go. And I will leave this place altogether, not just your sad shrine.~ [OH94938]
@3370 = ~As for the rest of the arena, it's a blight. But you know that already.~ [OH94939]
@3371 = ~How did you come to be here?~
@3372 = ~Indeed. I've a favor to ask. Would you fight with me in the next match?~
@3373 = ~I was defending a village on the Delimbiyr River against a band of raiding orcs. I had little more than a score of warriors at my command, but we were trained fighting men and women all. We formed a shield wall, seven wide and three deep, blocking the only trail into the village.~ [OH94943]
@3374 = ~Fascinating, I love tales of battle. Go on.~
@3375 = ~Sorry to interrupt. Will this story take long?~
@3376 = ~Skip to the part where you get captured. I don't have all day.~
@3377 = ~I stood in the center of the first line, my shield locked with those of my comrades left and right, a short sword in my free hand. In a shield wall, there's no room to swing a long blade.~ [OH94947]
@3378 = ~A hundred orcs or more charged us, as orcs will—a motley crew in complete disarray. Some wielded nothing more than sticks. Others had dented helmets and rusty swords.~ [OH94948]
@3379 = ~We met their charge. The line shook, but our feet were well planted and our wall held. They stood no chance.~ [OH94950]
@3380 = ~Then how were you made a prisoner here?~
@3381 = ~Was it so boring that you fell asleep and were captured?~
@3382 = ~Suddenly, in front of me, I saw the planetar. I do not know where she came from. She raised her sword and spread her wings. The air rippled in a silent explosion. All those around us, human and orc alike, fell as one.~ [OH94953]
@3383 = ~I understood she was challenging me to single combat. We traded blows for I know not how long. I've never met a fighter as skilled as she. Eventually, she brought me to one knee and put her sword's tip to my neck. I had no choice but to yield.~ [OH94954]
@3384 = ~Her companions put me in shackles. The next thing I knew, I was here.~ [OH94955]
@3385 = ~Each tale of battle is a prayer to Tempus. To interrupt one is sacrilege.~ [OH94959]
@3386 = ~My apologies. Please, continue.~
@3387 = ~I've never had much use for gods.~
@3388 = ~I care nothing for your god.~
@3389 = ~Then I've no use for you. Do not speak to me again.~ [OH94963]
@3390 = ~As I was about to say, I stood in the center of the first line. My shield was locked with those of my comrades left and right. In my free hand, I held my short sword. In a shield wall, there is no room to swing a long blade.~ [OH94964]
@3391 = ~Very well: In summary, the Hunters appeared and the planetar defeated me in single combat. Are you satisfied? I hope so, as we'll not speak again.~ [OH94965]
@3392 = ~I doubt we need each other's aid at this stage. If you're so skilled a combatant, you'll succeed on your own. When things get more difficult, we can revisit the matter.~ [OH94966]
@3393 = ~How does a man of your strength and martial skill end up in a pit like this?~
@3394 = ~You have done well enough for yourself thus far. Perhaps we will fight together another time.~ [OH94970]
@3395 = ~I hope so. What do you think of this place?~
@3396 = ~If we survive that long. How were you caught?~
@3397 = ~You fought valiantly against the sahuagin and the githyanki. Yes, I will fight at your side. The price of collaboration has been set at 1,500 gold pieces, correct?~ [OH94974]
@3398 = ~Indeed. And here it is.~
@3399 = ~Unfortunately, I don't have the gold. I'll return when I do.~
@3400 = ~Honor and glory aren't payment enough?~
@3401 = ~I will meet you in the arena.~ [OH94978]
@3402 = ~I was about to ask you the same. Let us unite our strengths. We share a bond forged by the violence of this place, a bond stronger than steel or iron. I look forward to joining you in the arena.~ [OH94979]
@3403 = ~You shoulda taken a look inside your pouches before asking me. I am still willing to join you, however. Return when you have the gold.~ [OH94980]
@3404 = ~Do you know who I am, <CHARNAME>? The next time you come to me with such a request, you would do well to take it seriously.~ [OH94981]
@3405 = ~I thought I made it clear we have nothing to talk about, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH94983]
@3406 = ~I hope you're faring well, <CHARNAME>. Is there anything I can do for you?~ [OH94984]
@3407 = ~I found this gauntlet in the Winged's chamber. I thought you might know what the inscription meant.~
@3408 = ~How are you doing in the arena?~
@3409 = ~How are your plans for escape coming along?~
@3410 = ~I have a plan to escape. Will you fight with me?~
@3411 = ~I would have you fight alongside me in the next match, if you're willing.~
@3412 = ~Nothing for now. Thank you.~
@3413 = ~What were you doing in the Winged's quarters?~ [OH94991]
@3414 = ~Looking for any advantage I could find. We must face the Winged sooner or later.~
@3415 = ~Nothing in particular. I was just curious and a little bored down here, to tell the truth.~
@3416 = ~I was looking for the equipment they took away when they brought us here. No luck so far, unfortunately.~
@3417 = ~I presumed she and the other Hunters would keep a few valuables. May as well try to make a profit while I'm here.~
@3418 = ~That's no business of yours.~
@3419 = ~I see. Researching your opponent, or weakening them prior to battle, is an integral part of warfare. Show me the gauntlet. Let's see if we can learn something from it.~ [OH94997]
@3420 = ~Perhaps you'd do better spending more time in the training hall. That said, you may have found something useful. Show me the gauntlet.~ [OH94998]
@3421 = ~What I would not do to have my blades Dragon Breath and Hornet Sting returned to me. Perhaps that gauntlet is something you or I could wear? Let me see it.~ [OH94999]
@3422 = ~I do not understand your kind. You are a prisoner. Your first and only concern should be regaining your freedom. Show me the gauntlet. Maybe it is something that will prove useful.~ [OH95000]
@3423 = ~As you wish; don't tell me more. Do show me that gauntlet, though. We might learn something useful.~ [OH95001]
@3424 = ~Hmm... I recognize the writing. It is the celestial tongue. It says: "To Faith, Family, Masters, and all Good Beings of Faerûn."~ [OH95002]
@3425 = ~These are the fourfold duties that are part of the Code of Torm!~ [OH95003]
@3426 = ~These are the fourfold duties that are part of the Code of Torm—the god who watches over the weak and the defenseless. ~ [OH95004]
@3427 = ~Why would a slaver have a gauntlet dedicated to such a god? Is it a trophy, taken from one of her victims?~ [OH95005]
@3428 = ~She is a celestial herself, and many of them do worship Torm. Could it be a reminder of her past? Has she fallen from her faith?~ [OH95006]
@3429 = ~Is there a way to use this to our advantage? I see none, but that may change. Keep the gauntlet safe. Unfortunately, we cannot wear it ourselves. It has power, but only a celestial may wield it.~ [OH95007]
@3430 = ~I'm finding more satisfaction there than I expected. There is little honor in this type of battle. Still, combat is a powerful draught for the spirit. Men such as I only truly live when we fight.~ [OH95008]
@3431 = ~There's nothing so pure as the emotions of battle. It cleanses the mind and shows everything else for what it truly is: artifice.~ [OH95022]
@3432 = ~I feel the same.~
@3433 = ~I never thought of it that way.~
@3434 = ~I'm just glad I'm still alive.~
@3435 = ~I enjoy most that moment when I see all life disappear from my enemy's eyes.~
@3436 = ~You and I are cut from the same cloth.~ [OH95027]
@3437 = ~How's your escape plan coming along?~
@3438 = ~I have a plan to escape. Will you join me?~
@3439 = ~Will you fight with me in the next match, as my brother in cloth?~
@3440 = ~Next time you enter the arena, give yourself up to the moment. You might feel what I do.~ [OH95032]
@3441 = ~Know this: Dennaton's time of reckoning approaches. Will you fight him with me?~
@3442 = ~Show me how. Fight with me in my next match.~
@3443 = ~Staying alive is a critical part of fighting!~ [OH95037]
@3444 = ~How go your plans for escape?~
@3445 = ~I plan to leave this place soon. Will you fight with me?~
@3446 = ~I've a better chance of surviving if you fight with me in my next match.~
@3447 = ~I know what you speak of. To derive pleasure from it is a mark of particular cruelty.~ [OH95044]
@3448 = ~I am as the gods made me. On another topic, I found this gauntlet in the Winged's chamber. Can you read the inscription?~
@3449 = ~I have a plan to escape. There will be an uprising soon. Will you fight with us?~
@3450 = ~I take it you wouldn't want to fight with me in my next match, then.~
@3451 = ~The more I think about it, the more a confrontation with the Winged and her followers seems unavoidable. As a group, they are exceedingly powerful. I must find a way to somehow undermine them ahead of time.~ [OH95050]
@3452 = ~Perhaps this will help. I took this gauntlet from the Winged's chambers. Can you read the inscription?~
@3453 = ~Will I battle my captors? Yes, of course I would. I will await the signal.~ [OH95057]
@3454 = ~I found this gauntlet in the Winged's chamber. Can you interpret the inscription?~
@3455 = ~I would have you battle more than just our captors. Join me in my next match.~
@3456 = ~Fortune—and Tempus—favor the bold. The Lord of Battles will guide our blades!~ [OH92878]
@3457 = ~This is our best opportunity to be free. We should seize it!~ [OH92883]
@3458 = ~Why would you agree to such a request? Tartle has made us all miserable.~ [OH92897]
@3459 = ~I too will try to spare him, but I can make no promises.~ [OH92912]
@3460 = ~Tempus, may you take pleasure in this day's battle! Help me stand true against my foes!~ [OH92925]
@3461 = ~I would gladly join you and strike a blow against Dennaton's tyranny, <CHARNAME>. But judging by this motley crew, it is best I stay to shore up our defenses.~ [OH92986]
@3462 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Your name will be sung wherever great deeds are held dear.~ [OH100624]
@3463 = ~And that suits you fine, doesn't it, Curell? How Tempus could have called such a coward to his service is beyond me. You should celebrate the arena for what it is: an opportunity to prove oneself in battle. The arena IS a battlefield! Instead, you flee from it. Tempus doesn't like deserters. You do know what he demands we do to deserters, don't you, Curell?~ [OH94574]
@3464 = ~You two incessantly wag your tongues at each other and do little else. If your disagreements are so profound, unsheathe your swords. Settle them like true warriors.~ [OH94592]
@3465 = ~That suits you fine, doesn't it, Curell? How Tempus could've called such a coward to his service is beyond me. You should celebrate the arena for what it is: an opportunity to prove oneself in battle. The arena IS a battlefield! Instead, you flee from it. Tempus doesn't like deserters. You do know what he demands we do to deserters, don't you, Curell?~ [OH94652]
@3466 = ~What do you know of skill and tactics? You never leave your shrine! A house of Tempus should not be some shady underground alcove. The battlefield, that is where we glorify him! You are a disgrace to our order.~ [OH94662]
@3467 = ~Hah! You talk of skill and tactics as though you know what they are. You never leave your shrine! A house of Tempus should not be some shady underground alcove. The battlefield, that is where we glorify him! You are a disgrace to our order.~ [OH94667]
@3468 = ~What would you know about skill and tactics, Curell? When did you last visit the training hall, or fight one of Stirv's menagerie? You never leave your shrine! This shady underground alcove is no fit place to worship. The field of battle, that is where we glorify him! You are a weakling and a disgrace to our order.~ [OH94682]
@3469 = ~Like you know anything of the battlefield. You never leave your shrine!~ [OH94695]
@3470 = ~Pah! Some of these guards aren't fit to wield a steak knife, much less a sword.~ [OH90501]
@3471 = ~This place is a blight upon Faerûn. Tempus demands I destroy you, it, and all these other heathens.~ [OH90551]
@3472 = ~Augh, mine head! By the Oak Father's leafy arse, I've never met a woman who could drink like that! One minute I'm singing with an ale in one hand and a wench in the other, and then I wake up here... Where in the Nine Hells am I?~ [OH90467]
@3473 = ~I was hoping you could tell me.~
@3474 = ~No clue. I'll ask someone else.~
@3475 = ~Your brain hurts? Well, at least it's a small problem.~
@3476 = ~Aye. Well, if you find out where the food, ale, and women are, come back and tell Voghiln!~ [OH90471]
@3477 = ~I would if I could, but the guards say nothing to me. I tell you this, though: From where I stand, it is looking like a room of some sort. Has a floor... walls... doors. Ja! We are in a room!~ [OH90472]
@3478 = ~How long have you been here?~
@3479 = ~Do you know why we were brought here?~
@3480 = ~My gods, you're right! I'll be leaving it now.~
@3481 = ~It would appear intelligence is not a prerequisite for being held here.~
@3482 = ~A couple of hours, maybe. Long enough to be getting hungry, I'll tell you this.~ [OH90477]
@3483 = ~Very well, thank you for your time.~
@3484 = ~You can get hungry? I find that hard to believe. Well, I must be going.~
@3485 = ~For you, that would take, what, five minutes?~
@3486 = ~I do not know why we were brought here. I am thinking I was snatched for my fame in fighting, drinking, and my way with the ladies.~ [OH90481]
@3487 = ~Thank you for your time. I must go now.~
@3488 = ~Are you sure you weren't brought here for your finely honed, razor-sharp wit?~
@3489 = ~Ja! And what can mighty Voghiln do for you?~ [OH91389]
@3490 = ~Ho ho, what have we here? Come raise a flagon with me! We'll drink till we die in the arena... or the bar. The bar is more likely for me.~ [OH91286]
@3491 = ~Drinking already? Isn't it a bit early for that?~
@3492 = ~Pour me a flagon, and let's get started!~
@3493 = ~All right, who taught the ape to talk and hold a flagon?~
@3494 = ~I thought I was getting a late start! What are you, some sort of paladin?~ [OH91290]
@3495 = ~I am a paladin, yes.~
@3496 = ~No. I just want to stay sober and survive my first day in this place.~
@3497 = ~No, but looking at you, I'm considering it.~
@3498 = ~Oh ho ho! A wild one we have here. Tell you what, my lady... after our first victory, come see me. We'll have a celebration all our own.~ [OH91294]
@3499 = ~Sounds like fun.~
@3500 = ~I think I'll pass. Who are you, anyway?~
@3501 = ~It'll take more than marginally coherent drunken babbling to seduce me, you oaf.~
@3502 = ~Good man! Come, have a drink with old Voghiln. I'll tell you secrets that will get you any woman in Faerûn. Assuming she isn't already with me, of course.~ [OH91299]
@3503 = ~Great. I've never had much luck with women.~
@3504 = ~Maybe I'll pass. Tell me your name.~
@3505 = ~Do you have any "secrets" that don't involve pouring gallons of ale down your throat?~
@3506 = ~Watch and learn. We are going to be good friends! I can feel it in my gut—and my gut's never wrong.~ [OH91304]
@3507 = ~It certainly isn't today. Nice to meet you.~
@3508 = ~One can't have too many friends, especially in a place like this. What's your name?~
@3509 = ~I see you keep it well supplied.~
@3510 = ~Ah—we've got a funny one!~ [OH91309]
@3511 = ~My apologies. Who are you again?~
@3512 = ~Who in the Nine Hells are you?~
@3513 = ~Try it and we'll see who laughs last.~
@3514 = ~That's unfortunate. But don't worry! Old Voghiln will loosen you up. I'll have you singing and drinking with the best of them in a tenday. If you're still alive, that is.~ [OH91313]
@3515 = ~I don't intend to die any time soon.~
@3516 = ~It's your own life you should worry about. Who are you?~
@3517 = ~Voghiln's the name. A fighter, drinker, and lover... though not necessarily in that order.~ [OH91317]
@3518 = ~How did you come to be here, Voghiln?~
@3519 = ~You seem to have many skills and stories.~
@3520 = ~Nice to meet you. I'll be going now.~
@3521 = ~You forgot "eater."~
@3522 = ~I'll tell you what I know and a few things I don't!~ [OH91322]
@3523 = ~You're a good fighter, I take it?~
@3524 = ~So, you said you know a thing or two about women?~
@3525 = ~I gather you like to have a drink now and then? Especially now.~
@3526 = ~How did you end up here, Voghiln?~
@3527 = ~That's all for now.~
@3528 = ~Funny you should ask. It seems most around here got their teeth kicked in by that Winged wench and her gang. But not Voghiln! They tricked me!~ [OH91328]
@3529 = ~Really? What happened?~
@3530 = ~How'd they manage that?~
@3531 = ~What did they do? Offer you some ale?~
@3532 = ~Eh, not so soon, not so soon. Win a few fights—then you'll have earned the right to hear the story of how they captured the mighty Voghiln!~ [OH91338]
@3533 = ~Fair enough. Can I ask you something else?~
@3534 = ~Fine. I'll be going now.~
@3535 = ~Pfft. They probably just dangled a banana in front of a giant sack.~
@3536 = ~Ach! I'll tell you another time... if you survive that long.~ [OH91342]
@3537 = ~That pretty little half-elf girl... Joker. She got me alone in my favorite tavern after I made some coin doing a job for High Captain Baram of Luskan.~ [OH91343]
@3538 = ~Ach, you are a smart one. That is exactly what happened!~ [OH91344]
@3539 = ~Never met anyone that could match me drink for drink, but she did. Next thing I knew, the room was spinning and I woke up in this place. Joker, hah! She is nothing to laugh at, I'll tell you that much!~ [OH91345]
@3540 = ~Interesting story. Can I ask you about something else?~
@3541 = ~That's good to know. I'll take my leave of you now.~
@3542 = ~I'll keep it in mind. Thank you.~
@3543 = ~Keep on joking. I'll put my boot so far up your arse you'll taste my sole!~ [OH91186]
@3544 = ~Keep on joking...~
@3545 = ~Well, come find me the next time you need a drink, a laugh, or a pummeling!~ [OH91349]
@3546 = ~Good at fighting? You could say that. I killed a dozen tundra yeti barehanded! Barehanded! You've heard of tundra yeti, yes?~ [OH91350]
@3547 = ~I'm afraid not.~
@3548 = ~Yes. Terrible creatures. A threat to all goodly folk.~
@3549 = ~Aye, I have.~
@3550 = ~Actually I'd rather hear of your recent fights in the arena.~
@3551 = ~I sort of feel like I'm talking to a partially shaved yeti right now.~
@3552 = ~Twice as tall as a man and thrice as wide. Claws and fangs like daggers. Reminds me of me, now I think of it, except for the claws and fangs, of course.~ [OH91356]
@3553 = ~I was escorting a caravan from the Ten Towns south to Luskan. We made camp for the night. I told them not to, but they didn't listen to Voghiln.~ [OH91357]
@3554 = ~In the middle of the night, a pack of yetis attacked. In the chaos, I lost my axe. I had to rip one of their hairy arms off and use it to club the others to death.~ [OH91358]
@3555 = ~The devils had killed the oxen and most of the guards. I had to pull the wagons to Luskan myself, fighting yetis and bandits the whole way!~ [OH91359]
@3556 = ~An impressive feat. Could I ask you something else?~
@3557 = ~I completely, totally believe you. And I'll be on my way now.~
@3558 = ~You spin a good yarn. I'll give you that, and wide berth to boot.~
@3559 = ~Saying Voghiln knows a thing or two about women is like saying Elminster can cast a few spells! I know things about women they don't even know about themselves.~ [OH91363]
@3560 = ~For instance?~
@3561 = ~Oh really? And what do you know about me I don't know of myself?~
@3562 = ~Perhaps we can discuss something else?~
@3563 = ~I'm guessing the only thing you know about women is how it feels when they slap your face.~
@3564 = ~Nice try. Figure out your own secrets.~ [OH91368]
@3565 = ~Fine, be that way. I have another question for you.~
@3566 = ~I'll do that. Farewell.~
@3567 = ~I know that you'll be giving in to my charms!~ [OH91372]
@3568 = ~We'll see. I have other questions for you now.~
@3569 = ~We'll never know. See you later, Voghiln.~
@3570 = ~You have charms? Er, what are they...?~
@3571 = ~You will change your mind. They all do!~ [OH91378]
@3572 = ~I like a drink... when I'm not fighting or sleeping or drinking already.~ [OH91379]
@3573 = ~We're going to get along fabulously. Can I ask you some questions?~
@3574 = ~Who doesn't? Me, that's who. I'll be going now.~
@3575 = ~You're clearly a man of many skills and stories.~
@3576 = ~Can I ask you a question about drinking?~
@3577 = ~Greetings, Voghiln. I've a question for you: What would it take to get you to join me in my next fight?~
@3578 = ~Hello, Voghiln. I was hoping you could help me with a plan.~
@3579 = ~Drinking? You have come to the right place, my friend! What do you want to know?~ [OH91398]
@3580 = ~Is it true you're a connoisseur of fine drinks?~
@3581 = ~Maybe we could have a few rounds of ale together?~
@3582 = ~Wait, never mind. I forgot I had decided to stop talking to semi-coherent drunks.~
@3583 = ~Maybe when you've won a few fights. I want to be sure I'm not left carrying your arse back to the bunk room.~ [OH91406]
@3584 = ~So, you think you are ready to drink with mighty Voghiln, do you? Fine. You are buying! Ho ho ho ho!~ [OH91407]
@3585 = ~Very well. This one's on me!~
@3586 = ~Looks like I don't have enough gold. Some other time.~
@3587 = ~Forget it. Buy your own ale.~
@3588 = ~My assistance does not come without a price.~ [OH91414]
@3589 = ~What price is that, then?~
@3590 = ~Never mind, then.~
@3591 = ~Pay for help from a half-drunk ape? Forget it!~
@3592 = ~1,500 gold pieces and my axe is yours.~ [OH91423]
@3593 = ~I would be honored to fight next to anyone who can drink me under the table. Just stay out of my way. I'd hate to cut you down along with the nasty buggers in the pits!~ [OH91428]
@3594 = ~For my last fight, I faced a bunch of minotaurs! Big ones too, and smart. They tried to outflank me, but I put my back to the wall and started swinging! We'll be eating roast beef tonight!~ [OH91430]
@3595 = ~Most impressive. May I ask you something else?~
@3596 = ~More likely the minotaurs caught a whiff of you and keeled over!~
@3597 = ~Heard any rumors of what to expect next?~
@3598 = ~Nothing specific, though I did overhear a guard muttering something about holy water and garlic...~ [OH91435]
@3599 = ~Ah! The fights are finally getting interesting! At first, those skinny, pointy-eared fellows didn't look so tough. Githyanki, Tartle calls them. But I'll tell you this: Those devils are fast.~ [OH91437]
@3600 = ~Glad you survived. Can I ask you something else?~
@3601 = ~There are glaciers that move faster than you, fat man.~
@3602 = ~Any word on what the next fight will be?~
@3603 = ~I cannot say for sure, but I heard Tartle muttering about a... phylactery? I do not know what that is, but if it is some sort of drink, I am going to get a taste of it!~ [OH91445]
@3604 = ~I faced some strange beasts yesterday. They looked like walking squids. I thought to myself, "It's seafood for dinner tonight!" Next thing I knew, the arena was spinning and it was all I could do to stand there as they wrapped their tentacles around my head and started biting at me.~ [OH91447]
@3605 = ~One of the other performers said they were trying to eat my brains.~ [OH91449]
@3606 = ~I'm glad you've got such a thick skull. Could I ask you something else?~
@3607 = ~Trying to get at your brains through your head? They should have checked the other end!~
@3608 = ~What do you think we'll face next?~
@3609 = ~Nobody has said anything, but last night, I was at the bar, and I heard a roaring and what sounded like huge wings flapping. Never saw where it came from though. Figured I'd had enough drink and went to bed.~ [OH91457]
@3610 = ~Oh ho ho! People have been talking about mighty Voghiln, have they now? Well, you know, where there's vultures, there's fighting!~ [OH91459]
@3611 = ~So it's true?~
@3612 = ~You certainly must be important. Who might that contact be, if you don't mind my asking?~
@3613 = ~I was thinking about challenging Joker to a drinking contest. Could you arrange that?~
@3614 = ~Or maybe there are vultures because you smell like a dead troll.~
@3615 = ~I suppose telling a friend like you wouldn't hurt... It was that Joker girl. The one that tricked me into coming here in the first place! She liked what she saw, if you know what I mean.~ [OH91529]
@3616 = ~I guess she did. I've another question for you.~
@3617 = ~Unfortunately, I know exactly what you mean. I'll be going now.~
@3618 = ~Or maybe she just likes drinking you under the table.~
@3619 = ~It is no secret that women can't stay away from me, and the half-elf that works for Dennaton is a woman... But I have not had enough to drink to be telling THAT story yet.~ [OH91533]
@3620 = ~Too bad. I'd like to hear it. I guess I'll go now.~
@3621 = ~Can I ask you about something else?~
@3622 = ~And I haven't drunk enough to listen to your blather.~
@3623 = ~Ahh! Now that is some good ale! Reminds me of some I had not too long ago. I tell you, it's good to have contacts upstairs.~ [OH91537]
@3624 = ~Perhaps you could care to tell me more? Over another round, of course.~
@3625 = ~I should be going now. Liquor and I are a dangerous combination.~
@3626 = ~It's also good to have baths. You should try one sometime.~
@3627 = ~Oh ho ho ho! Looks like you can't keep up with mighty Voghiln. Best be getting to bed before you fall out of your chair!~ [OH91541]
@3628 = ~Ja! You know that half-elf girl that works for Dennaton—Joker? Well, she has hardly left me alone since I got here. She cannot get enough of mighty Voghiln's company!~ [OH91542]
@3629 = ~Indeed? What can you tell me about her?~
@3630 = ~I'd like to hear more, but I'm afraid I must bid you good <DAYNIGHTALL> now.~
@3631 = ~She might not be able to get enough of you, but I certainly have. Goodbye.~
@3632 = ~Ja. Well... She's liking her ales as much as I do. And she is nice enough company, but... I would like to get her back for bringing me... here... Zzz...~ [OH91546]
@3633 = ~Of course! Everyone needs Voghiln's help. Where would you be without me? Now, tell me what you are needing.~ [OH91547]
@3634 = ~I intend to try to poison Joker.~
@3635 = ~I need help with a plan, but it is not quite ready yet. I need more items first.~
@3636 = ~Rumor is that you have connections around here.~
@3637 = ~It is a secret matter, but I should be able to trust an honorable warrior such as yourself.~
@3638 = ~Forget it. I need help from something smarter than the stone floor we are standing on.~
@3639 = ~I have had every drink there is from Calimshan to Kuldahar, but I am always looking to try another! You have something new for mighty Voghiln?~ [OH91554]
@3640 = ~I happen to have a very rare one right here! Try it.~
@3641 = ~I have the drink, but it's missing a special ingredient.~
@3642 = ~No, I was just wondering. I'll be going now.~
@3643 = ~Yes. Soap.~
@3644 = ~Hmm... *sniff* Smells good. Mmm... Tastes even better! Give me some more. Ja! That's some of the best I've ever tasted! I will have to tell Joker about this...~ [OH91559]
@3645 = ~We have fought in the same pit and are bound as warriors. If you cannot trust me, who can you trust? Now tell mighty Voghiln what you are thinking.~ [OH91560]
@3646 = ~I intend to try to poison Joker. Can you help?~
@3647 = ~On second thought, I've changed my mind. I'll take my leave of you now.~
@3648 = ~On second thought, I think I have changed my mind. I must be going.~
@3649 = ~Forget it, Voghiln. I trust Stirv's wyvern more than you.~
@3650 = ~Ho ho! Ever since that skinny half-elf captured me, I have been looking to put her in her place. This sounds like just the way to do it! What do you need?~ [OH91565]
@3651 = ~Tell her I have a drink so strong it'll knock her on her rear.~
@3652 = ~Nothing. This was a bad idea. I've got to go.~
@3653 = ~Forget it. I need someone who can speak in coherent sentences.~
@3654 = ~Are you sure you don't need me to bash some guards or break down some walls?~ [OH91569]
@3655 = ~That won't be necessary. Just mention the drink.~
@3656 = ~On second thought, forget it. I must be going.~
@3657 = ~In retrospect, it seems to me my scheme requires more subtlety than you're capable of. I'll get one of Stirv's umber hulks instead.~
@3658 = ~She will be coming to see you before you know it. She can't resist me.~ [OH91573]
@3659 = ~Challenging Joker to a drinking contest? Have you lost your mind? Well, it is your funeral. I'll let her know for you.~ [OH91574]
@3660 = ~You have my thanks, <CHARNAME>, and my word is true! I will return to the pits and slaughter the rest of the guards, but I want you to have these. Where you are going, you will need them more than I.~ [OH94316]
@3661 = ~Ah, you have had a stunning victory here today, <CHARNAME>! I'll raise a tankard or three in your name in every alehouse across Faerûn.~ [OH100617]
@3662 = ~Might as well. Food is food, and I believe a feast was mentioned.~ [OH90509]
@3663 = ~The Vast? What is this? I have never used such a nickname!~ [OH90547]
@3664 = ~Eh... Fine, it fits.~ [OH90549]
@3665 = ~You? The greatest warrior? Greatest halfling warrior, maybe, but that still only makes you half the warrior I am!~ [OH90575]
@3666 = ~I conquered the Nightmares! An entire clan of orcs wiped out in an afternoon!~ [OH90577]
@3667 = ~This is your only warning.~
@3668 = ~Attempt something like that again and you will be dealt with accordingly.~
@3669 = ~You were warned, mortal. Now face the consequences of your actions.~
@3670 = ~Dear <CHARNAME>, I have been contacted by an illustrious djinn, one with a true appreciation of your considerable talents, and a wish to offer you a most lucrative opportunity. Your presence is humbly requested for more formal introductions at my establishment in Tradesmeet.

As a token of our friend's generosity, a ring is enclosed accompanying this message. I can speak to the ring's fine quality, having received one myself for my role as intermediary, and he has promised us each additional gifts upon your arrival.

Yours faithfully,
Vyatri~
@3671 = ~Any guesses who this 'illustrious djinn' is?~
@3672 = ~Free magical rings with rubies the size of my thumb? That's a trap. Either the deadly kind, or the 'quadruple your riches with a modest investment' kind.~
@3673 = ~This has to be about one of those feuding noble nitwits, they probably cursed the ring.~
@3674 = ~Oh no. Not Trademeet again. The stench, the manure. Animals everywhere, braying ....~
