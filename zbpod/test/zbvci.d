== ANOMENJ IF ~InParty("Anomen") InMyArea("Anomen") !StateCheck("Anomen",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~An ill omen. Best we explore and gain our bearings.~
== CERNDJ IF ~InParty("Cernd") InMyArea("Cernd") !StateCheck("Cernd",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Nature cringes from this prison of steel and stone. Let us find our way out, or better yet, sunder this choking place.~

== HAERDAJ IF ~InParty("HaerDalis") InMyArea("HaerDalis") !StateCheck("HaerDalis",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Where do we find ourselves now, I wonder? Being thrown into the unknown on a whim - it almost reminds me of my beloved Sigil. Keys, portals, danger around every corner.~
== IMOEN2J IF ~InParty("Imoen") InMyArea("Imoen") !StateCheck("Imoen",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Heh. Seems we're trapped once again. This is starting to feel a little personal now. Let's break out of here fast, alright?~

== MINSCJ IF ~InParty("Minsc") InMyArea("Minsc") !StateCheck("Minsc",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~The people here are not free, <CHARNAME>. As heroes, we must break their chains. Boo will help.~

== YOSHJ IF ~InParty("Yoshimo") InMyArea("Yoshimo") !StateCheck("Yoshimo",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Tricked and then caged. Remind me to thank our captor with something sharp and precise. Ideally between their ribs.~
== DORNJ IF ~InParty("Dorn") InMyArea("Dorn") !StateCheck("Dorn",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Much danger may lurk in the darkness here. Unfortunately for our enemies I have darkvision and my strikes *never* miss.~
== HEXXATJ IF ~InParty("HEXXAT") InMyArea("HEXXAT") !StateCheck("HEXXAT",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Locked away like common cattle... How quaint. Let them savor their little victory. At least until we carve our way out.~
== NEERAJ IF ~InParty("NEERA") InMyArea("NEERA") !StateCheck("NEERA",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~Well...uh, my magic's not working. I mean, not all that strange, wild mage and all that, you know, really it does what it wants to. But I'm getting *nothing*. An anti-magic zone, maybe?~
== RASAADJ IF ~InParty("RASAAD") InMyArea("RASAAD") !StateCheck("RASAAD",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~The light of Selune will guide us even through this darkness.~
